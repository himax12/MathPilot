# Inverse Trigonometric Functions: Properties Of Inverse Trigonometric Functions

**JEE Frequency**: 14 years | **Questions**: 51

## Inverse Trigonometric Functions: Properties - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (14 years, 51 questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Expressions involving combinations of inverse trigonometric functions (e.g.,  `sin⁻¹(x) + cos⁻¹(y)`, `tan⁻¹(x) - cot⁻¹(y)`).
*   Equations involving inverse trigonometric functions, requiring simplification or solving for variables.
*   Questions testing the domain and range restrictions of inverse trigonometric functions.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Sum/Difference Identities:
    *   `tan⁻¹(x) + tan⁻¹(y) = tan⁻¹((x+y)/(1-xy))` (Consider quadrants based on sign of x, y and xy)
    *   `tan⁻¹(x) - tan⁻¹(y) = tan⁻¹((x-y)/(1+xy))`
*   Conversion Formulas:
    *   `sin⁻¹(x) + cos⁻¹(x) = π/2`
    *   `tan⁻¹(x) + cot⁻¹(x) = π/2`
    *   `sec⁻¹(x) + cosec⁻¹(x) = π/2`
*   Double Angle/Triple Angle Formulas (Conversion to other trig functions might be needed before applying inverse formulas)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Simplify:** Use identities to simplify the given expression. Look for patterns allowing sum/difference formulas to be applied.
2.  **Convert:** If necessary, convert all inverse functions to a single type (e.g., all to `tan⁻¹`) using trigonometric identities and right-angled triangles.
3.  **Substitute:** Introduce new variables (e.g., `θ = tan⁻¹(x)`) to transform the problem into a simpler trigonometric equation.
4.  **Solve:** Solve the simplified equation, paying attention to the domain and range of the inverse functions.
5.  **Verify:** Always verify the solution(s) by substituting them back into the original equation.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Domain & Range:** Remember the domain and range restrictions for each inverse trigonometric function. For example, `sin⁻¹(x)` has a range of `[-π/2, π/2]`. Violating these will lead to incorrect answers.
*   **Triangle Substitution:** Visualizing inverse trig functions using right-angled triangles often simplifies complex expressions (e.g., if `θ = sin⁻¹(x)`, visualize a triangle with opposite side x and hypotenuse 1).

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Ignoring Domain/Range:** This is the biggest trap. Always check if the final solution falls within the defined ranges of the inverse trigonometric functions involved.
*   **Quadrant Errors:**  In `tan⁻¹(x) + tan⁻¹(y)`, remember to add π if `x > 0`, `y > 0` and `xy > 1`, and subtract π if `x < 0`, `y < 0`, `xy > 1` to get the correct quadrant.
*   **Incorrect Simplification:** Double-check trigonometric identities to avoid algebraic errors during simplification and conversion.
