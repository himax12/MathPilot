# Parabola: Common Tangent

**JEE Frequency**: 10 years | **Questions**: 22

## Parabola: Common Tangent (JEE Knowledge Base)

**JEE Frequency:** 10 years
**Question Count:** 22 questions

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Finding tangents that touch both a parabola and another curve (circle, another parabola, hyperbola, etc.).
*   Questions involving finding the point of intersection of common tangents.
*   Problems asking for the equation of the common tangent itself, or its properties (slope, intercepts).

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Tangent to Parabola y² = 4ax:**  \(y = mx + \frac{a}{m}\)
*   **Tangent to Parabola x² = 4ay:** \(x = my + \frac{a}{m}\)
*   **Condition of Tangency:** For a general curve f(x, y) = 0, express the tangent in slope-intercept form (y = mx + c). Substitute in the curve's equation. For the line to be tangent, the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation should be zero (D = 0).

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Assume a General Tangent:** Start with the equation of the tangent to one of the curves (usually the parabola due to its simple tangent equation).  Use the standard form \(y = mx + \frac{a}{m}\) or \(x = my + \frac{a}{m}\).
2.  **Apply Tangency Condition:**  Substitute the assumed tangent equation into the equation of the *other* curve.
3.  **Solve for 'm':** Impose the condition of tangency (D = 0) for the resulting quadratic equation in x or y. This will give you the possible values of 'm'.
4.  **Determine the Common Tangent:** Substitute the obtained values of 'm' back into the assumed tangent equation.
5.  **Analyze the Solution:** If the question asks for the intersection point, solve the equations of the common tangents simultaneously.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Circle Special Case:** If one of the curves is a circle \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), the perpendicular distance from the center (0,0) to the tangent \(y = mx + \frac{a}{m}\) must equal the radius 'r'. Use: \(\frac{|\frac{a}{m}|}{\sqrt{1+m^2}} = r\)
*   **Symmetry:** If both curves are symmetric about an axis, the common tangents will also exhibit similar symmetry. This can significantly simplify calculations (e.g., tangents will have slopes m and -m).

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Forgetting the Discriminant Condition:** Not setting the discriminant of the quadratic equation to zero when applying the tangency condition.
*   **Algebraic Errors:** Carelessly solving quadratic equations or substituting values. Double-check your work.
*   **Incorrect Tangent Formula:** Using the wrong tangent equation for the parabola (e.g., confusing \(y^2 = 4ax\) and \(x^2 = 4ay\)).
