# 3D Geometry: Plane In Space

**JEE Frequency**: 15 years | **Questions**: 86

## 3D Geometry: Plane in Space - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (86 questions in 15 years)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Problems often involve finding the equation of a plane given points, normal vectors, angles with other planes/lines, or distances to points/other planes/spheres.
*   Questions frequently require finding the intersection of a plane with a sphere or a line. Look for questions dealing with the circle of intersection.
*   Shortest distance problems are common, often involving parallel planes or a plane and a sphere.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Equation of a plane:  \(ax + by + cz + d = 0\), where \(\langle a, b, c \rangle\) is the normal vector.
*   Equation of a plane passing through \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\) with normal vector \(\langle a, b, c \rangle\):  \(a(x - x_1) + b(y - y_1) + c(z - z_1) = 0\)
*   Distance from point \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\) to plane \(ax + by + cz + d = 0\):  \(D = \frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 + d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}\)
*   Angle \(\theta\) between two planes \(a_1x + b_1y + c_1z + d_1 = 0\) and \(a_2x + b_2y + c_2z + d_2 = 0\): \(\cos \theta = \frac{|a_1a_2 + b_1b_2 + c_1c_2|}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + b_1^2 + c_1^2} \sqrt{a_2^2 + b_2^2 + c_2^2}}\)
*   Distance between parallel planes \(ax + by + cz + d_1 = 0\) and \(ax + by + cz + d_2 = 0\): \(D = \frac{|d_2 - d_1|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}\)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify Given Information:** Carefully note all points, vectors, angles, distances, and equations provided.
2.  **Determine Unknown:** Clearly define what you are trying to find (equation of plane, distance, angle, etc.).
3.  **Apply Relevant Formulas:** Choose appropriate formulas based on the given information and desired result.  Consider using vector form if easier.
4.  **Solve for Unknowns:**  Set up equations and solve for the unknown parameters (coefficients of the plane equation, distance, angle, etc.).
5.  **Verify Solution:** Check your answer for consistency with the given information and perform a dimensional analysis to ensure the units are correct.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Parameterization:** When dealing with a plane passing through three points, parameterize the equation using two parameters (e.g., vectors along the plane).
*   **Normal Vector:** The coefficients of x, y, and z in the plane equation directly give the direction ratios of the normal vector.
*   **Family of Planes:** If a plane passes through the intersection of two other planes:  \(P_1 + \lambda P_2 = 0\) where \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) are the equations of the two planes, and \(\lambda\) is a constant.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrect Normal Vector:** Forgetting to normalize the normal vector when calculating distances or angles.
*   **Sign Errors:** Carelessly handling signs in the distance formula or when substituting coordinates.
*   **Confusing Distance Formulas:**  Using the wrong distance formula (e.g., confusing point-plane distance with plane-plane distance).  Always double check.
