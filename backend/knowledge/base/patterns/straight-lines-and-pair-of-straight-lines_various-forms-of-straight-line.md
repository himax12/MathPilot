# Straight Lines And Pair Of Straight Lines: Various Forms Of Straight Line

**JEE Frequency**: 15 years | **Questions**: 37

## Straight Lines: Various Forms - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (Frequently tested across various difficulty levels)
**Question Count (15 years):** 37

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Questions often involve finding the equation of a line given points, slopes, intercepts, or relationships with other lines.
*   Problems commonly involve transformations of line equations or using geometric properties to derive the equation of a line.
*   Keywords: "equation of line," "passes through," "intercepts," "parallel," "perpendicular," "fixed point."

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Slope-Point Form:  \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\)
*   Two-Point Form: \(y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)\)
*   Slope-Intercept Form: \(y = mx + c\)
*   Intercept Form: \(\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1\)
*   Normal/Perpendicular Form: \(x \cos \alpha + y \sin \alpha = p\)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify the Given Information:** Extract key details: points, slopes, intercepts, parallel/perpendicular relationships, angles.
2.  **Choose the Appropriate Form:** Select the line equation form that best utilizes the given information (e.g., slope-point if you have a point and a slope).
3.  **Substitute and Solve:**  Plug in the values into the chosen equation and solve for the unknown parameters (e.g., slope, intercept).
4.  **Check for Satisfying Conditions:** Verify that the resulting equation satisfies any additional constraints or conditions given in the problem.
5.  **Transform if necessary:** Convert the line to a specific form if required in the answer.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Homogenization:**  Use homogenization with the line equation when dealing with curves and lines to find points of intersection.
*   **Parametric Form:** Utilize the parametric form \(x = x_1 + r\cos\theta, y = y_1 + r\sin\theta\) when distance along a line is involved.  \(r\) represents the distance from the point \((x_1, y_1)\).
*   **Angle between lines:** Remember  \(\tan \theta = \left|\frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1m_2}\right|\)

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrect Slope:**  Be careful with signs and reciprocals when dealing with perpendicular lines (\(m_1m_2 = -1\)).
*   **Sign Errors:** Double-check signs when substituting values into equations, especially in intercept and slope forms.
*   **Misinterpreting Intercepts:**  Remember the x-intercept is the x-coordinate where the line crosses the x-axis (y=0) and vice versa.
