# Circle: Chord With A Given Middle Point

**JEE Frequency**: 14 years | **Questions**: 29

## Circle: Chord with Given Middle Point - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (14 years, 29 questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Questions explicitly state the midpoint (or a point lying on the chord) and ask for the equation of the chord or related circle properties.
*   Problem may involve finding the length of the chord given the midpoint.
*   Problems often involve finding parameters of the circle if the equation of a chord with a given midpoint is known.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Equation of chord with midpoint $$(x_1, y_1)$$ of circle $$x^2 + y^2 = a^2$$:  $$xx_1 + yy_1 = a^2$$ or $$T = S_1$$
*   Generalization for circle $$(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = a^2$$: $$(x-h)(x_1-h) + (y-k)(y_1-k) = a^2$$ or $$T=S_1$$ where $$T = (x-h)(x_1-h) + (y-k)(y_1-k)$$, and $$S_1 = (x_1-h)^2 + (y_1-k)^2$$
*   Relationship between distance from center to chord and chord length: If 'd' is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord, and 'l' is the half-length of the chord, and 'r' is the radius, then $$d^2 + l^2 = r^2$$.

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify the circle's center and radius:** Rewrite the circle's equation in standard form $$(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$$.
2.  **Apply the *T=S1* formula:** If the circle is $$x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$$, then  $$T = xx_1 + yy_1 + g(x + x_1) + f(y + y_1) + c$$ and $$S_1 = x_1^2 + y_1^2 + 2gx_1 + 2fy_1 + c$$.
3.  **Use the perpendicular distance formula:** Find the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord (using point-line distance formula), if required.
4.  **Relate distances and radius:** Use the Pythagorean relationship to find unknown lengths or radii, $$d^2 + l^2 = r^2$$.
5.  **Solve for unknowns:** Solve the resulting equation(s) to find the required parameters (e.g., midpoint coordinates, radius, equation of the chord).

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **T=S1 is your best friend:**  Directly applying $$T=S_1$$ significantly reduces computation time.
*   **Visualize:** Draw a quick diagram showing the circle, chord, midpoint, and center to understand the geometric relationships.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrect application of *T=S1*:**  Ensure the signs and terms are correctly substituted into the formula.  Remember to calculate both 'T' and 'S1' correctly.
*   **Forgetting circle's general form:** Remember the general equation of a circle $$x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$$ and its center $$(-g, -f)$$.
*   **Algebraic errors:** Be careful with algebraic manipulations when solving for unknown parameters, especially with square roots and fractions.
