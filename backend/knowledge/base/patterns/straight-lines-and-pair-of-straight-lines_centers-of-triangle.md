# Straight Lines And Pair Of Straight Lines: Centers Of Triangle

**JEE Frequency**: 10 years | **Questions**: 31

## Straight Lines: Centers of Triangle - Knowledge Base (JEE)

**JEE Frequency:** High (31 Questions in 10 Years)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Questions directly ask for coordinates of centroid, orthocenter, incenter, or circumcenter given vertices, side midpoints, or equations of sides/altitudes.
*   Problems often involve finding one center given information about other centers or related geometric properties (e.g., area, orthogonality).
*   Look for clues related to perpendicularity (orthocenter), angle bisectors (incenter), medians (centroid), and perpendicular bisectors (circumcenter).

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Centroid (G):**  If vertices are $$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)$$, then $$G = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, \frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3}\right)$$.
*   **Incenter (I):**  If vertices are $$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)$$ and side lengths opposite them are $$a, b, c$$ respectively, then $$I = \left(\frac{ax_1 + bx_2 + cx_3}{a+b+c}, \frac{ay_1 + by_2 + cy_3}{a+b+c}\right)$$.
*   **Circumcenter (O):** Intersection of perpendicular bisectors of sides. Often found by solving the system of equations formed by two perpendicular bisectors.
*   **Orthocenter (H):** Intersection of altitudes.  Slopes of altitudes are negative reciprocals of the slopes of the sides they are perpendicular to.
*   **Euler Line:** Centroid, Orthocenter and Circumcenter are collinear and divide in the ratio $$2:1$$. If O,G and H are circumcenter, centroid and orthocenter, then $$OG:GH= 1:2$$.

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify the Required Center:** Determine which center (centroid, incenter, orthocenter, circumcenter) the question is asking for.
2.  **Gather Information:** Note down all given coordinates, side lengths (if possible), equations of lines, and any relationships between the centers.
3.  **Apply Relevant Formula/Concept:** Use the appropriate formula to calculate the coordinates directly.  If side lengths for incenter are unknown, find them using the distance formula.  For orthocenter and circumcenter, find the equations of altitudes/perpendicular bisectors respectively and solve for their intersection.
4.  **Simplify and Substitute:** Simplify expressions and substitute values carefully to obtain the final answer.
5.  **Check Answer:** If time permits, quickly verify if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Midpoint Theorem:** If midpoints of sides are given, use the midpoint theorem to deduce the vertices of the triangle.
*   **Orthocenter & Slope:** Use the fact that the altitude from a vertex is perpendicular to the opposite side to relate slopes and find equations.
*   **Euler's line:** Use Euler's Line relation $$OG:GH = 1:2$$ if two of the centers are easily found.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrect Formula Application:** Memorize the formulas for different centers accurately.  Pay attention to the order of terms in the incenter formula.
*   **Sign Errors:** Be extremely careful with signs when calculating slopes, distances, and equations of lines.
*   **Algebraic Errors:**  Avoid simple algebraic mistakes when solving systems of equations. Double-check your work.
*   **Confusing Centers:** Mixing up the properties and methods for finding different centers. Practice identifying each center's defining characteristics.
