# Parabola: Tangent To Parabola

**JEE Frequency**: 10 years | **Questions**: 38

## Parabola: Tangents - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (Appears Almost Every Year)
**Question Count (10 years):** 38

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   **Tangent Equation Given/Required:** Problems often involve finding the equation of a tangent given a condition (slope, point, perpendicularity) or finding a condition given the tangent equation.
*   **Intersection with other curves:** Frequently, tangents intersect with other curves like circles, lines, or other parabolas, creating systems of equations to solve.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Parabola Equation:**  \(y^2 = 4ax\)
*   **Tangent Equation (Slope form):** \(y = mx + \frac{a}{m}\)
*   **Tangent Equation (Point form):** \(T = 0\) where \(T = yy_1 - 2a(x+x_1)\) at point \((x_1, y_1)\) on the parabola.
*   **Condition for \(y=mx+c\) to be a Tangent:** \(c = \frac{a}{m}\)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify Parabola Equation:** Determine the standard form of the parabola and the value of 'a'.
2.  **Choose Tangent Form:** Select the appropriate tangent equation (slope form if slope is known, point form if a point is known or can be assumed parametrically).
3.  **Apply Given Condition:** Use the provided information (slope, perpendicularity, intersection with another curve) to form an equation. This often involves substitution or solving a system of equations.
4.  **Solve for Unknowns:** Solve for the unknown parameters (slope 'm', point coordinates, etc.).
5.  **Write Tangent Equation:** Substitute the found values back into the tangent equation.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Parametric Coordinates:** Use parametric coordinates \((at^2, 2at)\) to simplify calculations when dealing with a general point on the parabola.
*   **Perpendicular Tangents:** Product of slopes of perpendicular tangents to a parabola \(y^2 = 4ax\) is -1, and point of intersection lies on the directrix \(x = -a\).

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrect Tangent Form:** Using the wrong tangent form (slope vs. point) can complicate the problem unnecessarily.
*   **Algebraic Errors:**  Be careful with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with quadratic equations arising from intersection conditions.
*   **Forgetting Condition for Tangency:** Remember the fundamental condition for a line to be tangent to a parabola, \(c = \frac{a}{m}\).
