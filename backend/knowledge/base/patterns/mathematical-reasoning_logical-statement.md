# Mathematical Reasoning: Logical Statement

**JEE Frequency**: 12 years | **Questions**: 25

## JEE Math: Mathematical Reasoning - Logical Statements

**JEE Frequency:** 12 Years
**Question Count:** 25

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Questions involve analyzing and manipulating logical statements using connectives like 'and', 'or', 'if...then', 'if and only if', and negation.
*   Often involve finding the negation, contrapositive, or inverse of a given statement.
*   May require determining the truth value of a compound statement based on the truth values of its components.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Negation:**
    *   $\sim(p \land q) \equiv \sim p \lor \sim q$ (De Morgan's Law)
    *   $\sim(p \lor q) \equiv \sim p \land \sim q$ (De Morgan's Law)
    *   $\sim(\sim p) \equiv p$
    *   $\sim(p \implies q) \equiv p \land \sim q$
    *   $\sim(p \iff q) \equiv (p \land \sim q) \lor (q \land \sim p)$  (Exclusive OR)
*   **Conditional Statement:** $p \implies q \equiv \sim p \lor q$
*   **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of $p \implies q$ is $\sim q \implies \sim p$. They are logically equivalent.
*   **Converse:** The converse of $p \implies q$ is $q \implies p$.
*   **Inverse:** The inverse of $p \implies q$ is $\sim p \implies \sim q$. The inverse and converse are logically equivalent.

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify Atomic Statements:** Break down the given statement into its simplest components (p, q, r, etc.).
2.  **Represent Symbolically:** Express the compound statement using logical connectives ($\land, \lor, \implies, \iff, \sim$).
3.  **Apply Logical Equivalences:** Use De Morgan's Laws, conditional statement equivalence, etc., to simplify the expression.
4.  **Determine Truth Value (if needed):** Construct a truth table if necessary to evaluate the truth value of the statement for different combinations of truth values of the atomic statements.
5.  **Find Negation/Contrapositive/etc.:** Apply the appropriate formulas to derive the required statement.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Truth Tables:**  Use truth tables strategically, especially when dealing with complex statements or questions about equivalence.
*   **Contrapositive Saves Time:** When asked about the validity of "If P then Q," consider proving the contrapositive "If not Q then not P," as they are logically equivalent. This sometimes simplifies the reasoning.
*   **Quantifiers (For All/There Exists):** The negation of "For all x, P(x)" is "There exists x such that not P(x)".  The negation of "There exists x such that P(x)" is "For all x, not P(x)".

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrect Negation of Conditional Statements:**  The most common mistake is to negate $p \implies q$ as $\sim p \implies \sim q$. Remember it's $p \land \sim q$.
*   **Confusing Converse/Inverse/Contrapositive:** Clearly distinguish between these three related forms of a conditional statement. Write them down explicitly to avoid errors.
*   **Misinterpreting "If and Only If":**  $p \iff q$ means $(p \implies q) \land (q \implies p)$. Don't forget to consider both directions when negating or manipulating biconditional statements.
