# Complex Numbers: Algebra Of Complex Numbers

**JEE Frequency**: 13 years | **Questions**: 45

## Complex Numbers: Algebra of Complex Numbers - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (13 years, 45 Questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Manipulation of complex number expressions to simplify or find real/imaginary parts.
*   Geometric interpretation of complex numbers in the Argand plane (distances, rotations).
*   Solving equations involving complex variables *z*.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Complex Number Representation:  \(z = x + iy = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = re^{i\theta}\)
*   Modulus: \(|z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = r\)
*   Argument: \(\arg(z) = \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\)
*   Triangle Inequality:  \(|z_1 + z_2| \le |z_1| + |z_2|\) and \(|z_1 - z_2| \ge | |z_1| - |z_2| |\)
*   Conjugate: \(\overline{z} = x - iy\), and \(z\overline{z} = |z|^2\)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Simplify:** Use algebraic manipulations (e.g., rationalization, expansion) to express the complex number in the form \(x + iy\).
2.  **Apply Definitions:** Use definitions of modulus, argument, conjugate to isolate real and imaginary parts or to relate complex numbers.
3.  **Geometric Interpretation:** Visualize the problem on the Argand plane, especially for questions involving distances and inequalities.
4.  **Solve Equations:** Substitute \(z = x + iy\) into the given equation and solve the resulting system of equations for *x* and *y*.
5.  **Utilize Euler's form:** Convert to and from polar form \(re^{i\theta}\) when dealing with powers and roots.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Rationalization:** Always rationalize the denominator when you have a complex number in the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
*   **Triangle Inequality:** Use the triangle inequality to find the maximum and minimum values of the modulus.
*   **Argand Plane is Your Friend:** Sketching the Argand plane can give you valuable insights into the geometric relationships between complex numbers, especially for inequalities and locus problems.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Argument Quadrant:**  Be careful to choose the correct quadrant for the argument \(\theta\) when using \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\). Consider the signs of *x* and *y*.
*   **Incorrect Conjugate:**  Don't mistakenly apply the conjugate property across addition or subtraction inside a modulus. For example, \(|\overline{z_1 + z_2}| = |\overline{z_1} + \overline{z_2}| \neq |\overline{z_1}| + |\overline{z_2}|\).
*   **Forgetting Triangle Inequality Conditions:** Remember when triangle inequality becomes an equality. \(|z_1+z_2| = |z_1| + |z_2|\) when \(\arg(z_1) = \arg(z_2)\)
