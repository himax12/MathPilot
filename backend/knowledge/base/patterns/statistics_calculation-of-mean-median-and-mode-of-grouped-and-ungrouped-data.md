## Worked Examples

### Example 1 (Year: 2002)

**Question:**

In a class of 100 students there are 70 boys whose average marks in a subject are 75. If the average marks of the complete class is 72, then what is the average marks of the girls?

**Solution:**

Given that, total students = 100
<br><br>and number of boys = 70
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ No. of  girls = 100 - 70 = 30
<br><br>Average of 100 students = 72 
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ Total marks of 100 students = 100 $$ \times $$ 72 = 7200 
<br><br>Average of 70 boys = 75 
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ Total marks of 70 boys = 70 $$ \times $$ 75 = 5250
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ Total marks of 30 girls = 7200 $$ - $$ 5250 = 1950
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ Average marks of 30 girls = $${{1950} \over {30}}$$ = 65 

### Example 2 (Year: 2003)

**Question:**

The median of a set of 9 distinct observations is 20.5. If each of the largest 4 observations of
the set is increased by 2, then the median of the new set :

**Solution:**

Here total no of observation is 9 which is a odd number. As we know for odd number 9 the median will be the 5<sup>th</sup> term.
<br><br>Now question says, you increase largest 4 number by 2 which does not affect the 5<sup>th</sup> term so the new median will be the same.

### Example 3 (Year: 2005)

**Question:**

If in a frequency distribution, the mean and median are 21 and 22 respectively, then
its mode is approximately :

**Solution:**

Given that, 
<br><br>Mean = 21  and median = 22
<br><br>We know, 
<br><br>Mode + 2 Mean = 3 Median
<br><br>$$\therefore$$  Mode = 3 $$ \times $$ 22 $$-$$ 2 $$ \times $$ 21
<br><br>= 66 $$-$$ 42
<br><br>= 24 

### Example 4 (Year: 2007)

**Question:**

The average marks of boys in a class is 52 and that of girls is 42. The average marks of boys
and girls combined is 50. The percentage of boys in the class is

**Solution:**

Let x and y are number of boys and girls in a class respectively. 
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ 52x + 42y = 50 (x + y)
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow$$ 52x + 42y = 50x + 50y
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow$$ 2x = 8y
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow$$ x = 4y
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ Total no. of students = x + y = 4y + y = 5y
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ Percentage of boys = $${{4y} \over {5y}} \times 100\,\% $$ = 80%

### Example 5 (Year: 2015)

**Question:**

The mean of the data set comprising of 16 observations is 16. If one of the observation valued 16 is deleted
and three new observations valued 3, 4 and 5 are added to the data, then the mean of the resultant data, is :

**Solution:**

Initially we have $$16$$ observations and among them one is $$16.$$ 
<br><br>So, we have $$15$$ unknowns. Let those are $${a_1},a{}_2,{a_3}.....{a_{15}}$$ 
<br><br>$$\therefore\,\,\,$$ Mean of $$16$$ datal set 
<br><br>$$ = {{{a_1} + {a_2} + .....{a_{15}} + 16} \over {16}}$$
<br><br>According to the question, 
<br><br>$${{{a_1} + {a_2} + .....{a_{15}} + 16} \over {16}} = 16$$ 
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow {a_1} + {a_2} + ...... + {a_{15}} = 256 - 16 = 240$$ 
<br><br>Now we deleted  $$16$$ and replaced by there new numbers $$3,4,$$ and $$5.$$ 
<br><br>So, new mean 
<br><br>$$ = {{{a_1} + {a_2} + .......{a_{15}} + \left( {3 + 4 + 5} \right)} \over {18}}$$ 
<br><br>$$ = {{240 + \left( {3 + 4 + 5} \right)} \over {18}}$$ 
<br><br>$$ = {{240 + 12} \over {18}}$$ 
<br><br>$$=14$$
