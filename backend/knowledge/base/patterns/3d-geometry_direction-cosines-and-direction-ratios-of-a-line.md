# 3D Geometry: Direction Cosines And Direction Ratios Of A Line

**JEE Frequency**: 14 years | **Questions**: 21

## 3D Geometry: Direction Cosines & Direction Ratios - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** 14 years
**Question Count:** 21 questions

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Problems often involve finding the angle between a line and coordinate axes or between two lines.
*   Questions often provide relationships between angles (e.g., a line making equal angles with x and z axes) and require finding direction cosines or ratios.
*   Finding the direction ratios of a line given by the intersection of two planes is a common scenario.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Direction Cosines (l, m, n):**  `l = cos α`, `m = cos β`, `n = cos γ`, where α, β, γ are angles with x, y, z axes respectively.
*   **Relationship between Direction Cosines:** `l² + m² + n² = 1`
*   **Direction Ratios (a, b, c):** Any set of numbers proportional to direction cosines. `a = λl`, `b = λm`, `c = λn`, where λ is a non-zero constant.
*   **Angle θ between two lines with direction cosines (l₁, m₁, n₁) and (l₂, m₂, n₂):** `cos θ = l₁l₂ + m₁m₂ + n₁n₂`
*   **Angle θ between two lines with direction ratios (a₁, b₁, c₁) and (a₂, b₂, c₂):** `cos θ = (a₁a₂ + b₁b₂ + c₁c₂) / √(a₁² + b₁² + c₁²)√(a₂² + b₂² + c₂²)`

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify Given Information:** Determine if direction cosines, direction ratios, angles with axes, or equations of lines/planes are provided.
2.  **Apply Core Formulas:** Use `l² + m² + n² = 1` to find missing direction cosines if angles are given.  If direction ratios are given, normalize them to find direction cosines.
3.  **Find Direction Ratios of Intersection of Planes:** Solve the system of equations representing the planes. Express x and z in terms of y (or any consistent parameter). The coefficients of the parameter in the expressions for x, y, and z represent direction ratios.
4.  **Apply Angle Formula:** Use the appropriate formula (`cos θ = ...`) to find the angle between lines. Ensure you use direction cosines or direction ratios consistently.
5.  **Solve for Unknowns:**  Use given relationships between angles or direction cosines to form equations and solve for the required quantity.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Memorize key trigonometric identities:** Simplifies calculations involving angles.
*   **Perpendicular Lines:** If two lines are perpendicular, `l₁l₂ + m₁m₂ + n₁n₂ = 0` or `a₁a₂ + b₁b₂ + c₁c₂ = 0`.
*   **Parallel Lines:** If two lines are parallel, their direction ratios are proportional.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Confusing Direction Cosines and Direction Ratios:** Always normalize direction ratios before using them in formulas that require direction cosines.
*   **Incorrectly Applying Angle Formula:** Double-check whether you are using direction cosines or ratios, and use the correct formula accordingly.
*   **Forgetting `l² + m² + n² = 1`:** Crucial for solving many problems; it relates direction cosines.
