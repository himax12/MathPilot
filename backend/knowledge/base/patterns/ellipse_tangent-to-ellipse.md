# Ellipse: Tangent To Ellipse

**JEE Frequency**: 7 years | **Questions**: 23

## Ellipse: Tangent to Ellipse - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** 7 years
**Question Count:** 23

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Problem involves finding the equation of a tangent, its properties (slope, intercepts), or the locus of a related point (e.g., midpoint of tangent segment).
*   Keywords like "tangent", "normal", "touches", "intercepts", "area of triangle formed by tangent", "perpendicular tangents" are present.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Equation of Ellipse:** $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$
*   **Tangent at point (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) on the Ellipse:** $\frac{xx_1}{a^2} + \frac{yy_1}{b^2} = 1$
*   **Tangent in Slope Form (y = mx + c):** $c^2 = a^2m^2 + b^2$
*   **Parametric Tangent:** $\frac{x\cos\theta}{a} + \frac{y\sin\theta}{b} = 1$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify the Given:**  Note down ellipse equation, point, slope, or any other provided condition.
2.  **Choose Appropriate Tangent Form:** Select either point form, slope form, or parametric form, depending on the given information. Slope form is very useful when dealing with conditions like "perpendicular tangents."
3.  **Apply the Condition:** Substitute the given condition (point on ellipse, slope, intercept etc.) into the chosen tangent equation.
4.  **Solve for Unknowns:** Solve the resulting equation(s) to find the unknown parameters (e.g., slope *m*, parameter *θ*, or constants *a* and *b*).
5.  **Find the Required Quantity:** Substitute the found parameters back into the tangent equation or other relevant formulas to obtain the desired result (e.g., area, locus, length).

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Slope Form is Versatile:**  When unsure, start with the slope form and use the given conditions to find the slope. Especially useful if the problem mentions angles, perpendicularity, or parallel lines.
*   **Parametric Form Simplifies Calculations:**  Use the parametric form when dealing with problems involving points on the ellipse without known coordinates. The substitution of *x = a cos θ* and *y = b sin θ* often simplifies the algebraic manipulation.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Confusing *a* and *b*:**  Make sure you correctly identify *a* and *b* from the ellipse equation, remembering *a* is always greater than *b* (major and minor axis).
*   **Forgetting the Condition for Tangency:**  Double-check that you correctly apply the condition $c^2 = a^2m^2 + b^2$ when using the slope form of the tangent. A common mistake is to solve a quadratic incorrectly and end up with wrong slopes.
*   **Incorrectly differentiating implicitly:** If the point is not *on* the ellipse, deriving a tangent equation implicitly from $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$  is tricky and error-prone. Use the slope form and tangency condition instead.
