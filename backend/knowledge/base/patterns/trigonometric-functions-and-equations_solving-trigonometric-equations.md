# Trigonometric Functions And Equations: Solving Trigonometric Equations

**JEE Frequency**: 10 years | **Questions**: 54

## Trigonometric Functions and Equations: Solving Trigonometric Equations - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency (10 years):** High (54 Questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   The problem asks for the *number* of solutions or the *sum* of solutions within a specific interval.
*   The equation involves trigonometric functions like sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, cot, or combinations thereof, potentially with multiple angles (2x, 3x, etc.).
*   Often involves algebraic manipulation and trigonometric identities to simplify the equation.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **General Solutions:**
    *   `sin(x) = sin(α) => x = nπ + (-1)^n α, n ∈ Z`
    *   `cos(x) = cos(α) => x = 2nπ ± α, n ∈ Z`
    *   `tan(x) = tan(α) => x = nπ + α, n ∈ Z`
*   **Key Identities:**
    *   `sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1`
    *   `sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)`
    *   `cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) = 2cos^2(x) - 1 = 1 - 2sin^2(x)`
    *   `cos(A) + cos(B) = 2cos((A+B)/2)cos((A-B)/2)`
    *   `sin(A) + sin(B) = 2sin((A+B)/2)cos((A-B)/2)`
    *   `cos(A)cos(B) = 1/2 [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)]`
    *   `sin(A)sin(B) = 1/2 [cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)]`
    *   `sin(A)cos(B) = 1/2 [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)]`

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Simplify:** Use trigonometric identities to reduce the equation to a simpler form, ideally involving a single trigonometric function and single angle.
2.  **Solve for the Trigonometric Function:** Isolate the trigonometric function (sin x, cos x, tan x, etc.) algebraically. This might involve factoring, quadratic equations, etc.
3.  **Find the General Solution:** Determine the general solution(s) for the trigonometric function you solved for.  Use the core formulas.
4.  **Find Particular Solutions:** Find all solutions within the given interval by substituting different integer values of 'n' in the general solution.
5.  **Verify Solutions:** Check all solutions obtained in step 4 against the original equation to eliminate any extraneous solutions (introduced due to squaring or other manipulations). Specifically important when dealing with tan, cot, sec, and csc.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Quadrant Analysis:** Use quadrant analysis to quickly determine possible solutions within the given interval. Remember the ASTC rule (All Students Take Calculus).
*   **Transform Sums to Products:** When you see sums or differences of trigonometric functions, try to use the sum-to-product formulas.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Missing General Solutions:** Forgetting to include the general solution (with 'n') and only finding a few particular solutions.
*   **Extraneous Solutions:** Not verifying solutions after squaring or performing other operations that might introduce extraneous solutions.
*   **Domain Restrictions:** Forgetting about the domain restrictions of tan, cot, sec, and csc. (e.g., tan(x) is undefined at x = π/2 + nπ).
