# Unknown: General

**JEE Frequency**: 8 years | **Questions**: 236

## JEE Math Knowledge Base: General Problem Solving

**Chapter:** Mixed (Often integrates multiple chapters)
**Topic:** General Problem Solving Strategies & Application of Concepts
**JEE Frequency:** ~8 years (per question type, highly variable)
**Question Count:** 236+ (Extremely common to encounter problems drawing from multiple areas)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Problems often require the integration of knowledge from multiple chapters (e.g., Trigonometry + Quadratic Equations, Calculus + Coordinate Geometry, Probability + Combinations).
*   Look for keywords or phrases that hint at specific techniques (e.g., "least value", "maximum", suggests AM-GM or Calculus). Conditional Probability keywords: "given that..."
*   Often involves algebraic manipulation and simplification before applying a core concept.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   AM-GM Inequality:  For non-negative numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, $\frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 ... a_n}$.
*   Quadratic Formula: For $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
*   Trigonometric Identities: Comprehensive knowledge of trigonometric identities, especially double/half angle formulas and transformations.
*   Binomial Theorem: $(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k}y^k$
*   Basic Probability Formulas: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Read Carefully:** Understand the question's objective and constraints. Identify the key information.
2.  **Simplify & Transform:** Manipulate the given expressions algebraically to a recognizable form.
3.  **Apply Core Concepts:** Utilize relevant formulas, theorems, and inequalities.
4.  **Check for Validity:** Ensure the solution satisfies all given conditions and constraints.  Especially important for inequalities and domain restrictions.
5.  **Eliminate Options:** If possible, eliminate incorrect answer choices based on estimations or specific properties.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Substitution:**  If an expression is complicated, substitute it with a variable to simplify it.
*   **Estimation:** When exact calculation is difficult, approximate values to get a rough estimate of the answer. Useful for eliminating options.
*   **Test Cases:** If possible, plug in specific values to test if a potential solution satisfies the conditions.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Algebraic Errors:** Careless errors during simplification can lead to incorrect answers. Double-check each step.
*   **Ignoring Constraints:** Forgetting to consider domain restrictions or other constraints can lead to extraneous solutions.
*   **Incorrectly Applying Inequalities:** Misapplying AM-GM or other inequalities, especially concerning equality conditions. Make sure variables are non-negative if using AM-GM.
