# Application Of Derivatives: Tangent And Normal

**JEE Frequency**: 16 years | **Questions**: 52

## Application of Derivatives: Tangent and Normal (JEE Knowledge Base)

**JEE Frequency:** High (16 years, 52 questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Problems involve finding equations of tangents and normals to given curves.
*   Keywords: "Tangent," "Normal," "Slope of Tangent," "Parallel," "Perpendicular," "Angle between curves."

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Slope of Tangent:  $$m_T = \frac{dy}{dx}$$
*   Equation of Tangent at $$(x_1, y_1)$$:  $$y - y_1 = \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{(x_1, y_1)} (x - x_1)$$
*   Slope of Normal: $$m_N = -\frac{1}{\frac{dy}{dx}} = -\frac{dx}{dy}$$
*   Equation of Normal at $$(x_1, y_1)$$: $$y - y_1 = -\frac{dx}{dy}\Big|_{(x_1, y_1)} (x - x_1)$$
*   Angle between curves (tangents) at intersection:  $$\tan{\theta} = \Big|\frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1m_2}\Big|$$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$:** Differentiate the given curve equation with respect to *x*.  For parametric curves, use $$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/d\theta}{dx/d\theta}$$.
2.  **Evaluate at the point:** Substitute the given point (or parameter value) into $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to find the slope of the tangent ($m_T$) at that point.
3.  **Find the slope of the normal:**  Calculate the slope of the normal using $$m_N = -\frac{1}{m_T}$$.
4.  **Write the equation:** Use the point-slope form to write the equation of the tangent and/or normal.
5.  **Solve for unknowns (if any):** The problem may require finding unknown parameters or points based on given conditions (e.g., parallel to x-axis, passing through a specific point).

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Parametric Equations:**  Always find dy/dx in terms of the parameter.
*   **Orthogonal Curves:** If two curves are orthogonal, the product of their slopes at the point of intersection is -1 ($m_1m_2 = -1$).

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrect Differentiation:** Double-check differentiation, especially when dealing with implicit functions or parametric equations.
*   **Forgetting to Evaluate the Slope:**  Always substitute the point of tangency into $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to find the *specific* slope at that point.
*   **Confusing Tangent and Normal:** Ensure you're using the correct slope (m or -1/m) when writing the equation.
