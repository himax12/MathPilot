# Functions: Classification Of Functions

**JEE Frequency**: 13 years | **Questions**: 36

## JEE Math Knowledge Base: Functions - Classification of Functions

**JEE Frequency:** 13 years
**Question Count:** 36 questions

This document provides a concise guide to tackling questions related to the classification of functions, a frequently tested topic in JEE.

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Questions typically involve checking if a function is one-one (injective), onto (surjective), bijective (both), or invertible.
*   Problems often define the function's domain and codomain explicitly and ask for the nature of the function based on these sets.
*   Inverse functions are frequently tested along with compositions and functional equations.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **One-One (Injective):** If $f(x_1) = f(x_2) \implies x_1 = x_2$ OR $f'(x) > 0$ or $f'(x) < 0$ throughout the domain.
*   **Onto (Surjective):** Range of $f(x)$ = Codomain.
*   **Inverse Function:** If $y = f(x)$, then $x = f^{-1}(y)$.  To find $f^{-1}(x)$, interchange $x$ and $y$ in the equation $y = f(x)$ and solve for $y$.
*   **Bijection:** A function is bijective if it is both one-one and onto.  Bijective functions have inverses.

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Check for One-One:** Use the definition or derivative test. Show $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ implies $x_1 = x_2$, or analyze the sign of $f'(x)$.
2.  **Check for Onto:** Determine the range of the function.  If the range equals the codomain, the function is onto. If not, it is "into".
3.  **Determine if Bijective:** If the function is both one-one and onto, it is bijective.
4.  **Find Inverse (if required):** Let $y = f(x)$. Interchange $x$ and $y$ and solve for $y$ to get $y = f^{-1}(x)$. Ensure the domain and range of the inverse are consistent.
5.  **Verify the Inverse:** Check if $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ and $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Graphical Method:** Use graphs to visually check for one-one (horizontal line test) and onto (range covering the entire codomain).
*   **Monotonicity:**  Strictly increasing or strictly decreasing functions are always one-one (injective).
*  **Use special properties:** If a function is strictly increasing/decreasing on its domain then number of solution to $f(x)=k$ can have atmost one solution.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrectly determining the range:** The range must be determined accurately to check for onto. Use domain restrictions and function properties.
*   **Forgetting Domain/Codomain Restrictions:**  Always consider the specified domain and codomain when classifying the function.  A function might be onto for one codomain but not for another. The function type (onto, into) changes with codomain.
*   **Assuming all functions have inverses:** Only bijective functions have inverses.  Verify that the function is bijective before attempting to find the inverse.
