# Height And Distance: Height And Distance

**JEE Frequency**: 14 years | **Questions**: 41

## Height and Distance: JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (14 years, 41 questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Problems involve angles of elevation/depression relating heights and horizontal distances.
*   Look for right-angled triangles formed by the observer, object, and the horizontal ground.
*   Keywords: Angle of elevation, angle of depression, height, distance, tower, pole, building.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   $$\tan \theta = \frac{\text{Perpendicular}}{\text{Base}}$$
*   $$\sin \theta = \frac{\text{Perpendicular}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$$
*   $$\cos \theta = \frac{\text{Base}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$$
*   Useful values: $\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, $\tan 45^\circ = 1$, $\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Draw a Diagram:** This is crucial.  Represent the situation with a clear diagram, labeling all known quantities (angles, distances).
2.  **Identify Right-Angled Triangles:** Look for right triangles where trigonometric ratios can be applied.
3.  **Apply Trigonometric Ratios:**  Use $\tan$, $\sin$, or $\cos$ based on the given information to relate the sides and angles.
4.  **Solve Equations:** Form equations using the ratios and solve for the unknown height or distance.
5.  **Check for Multiple Triangles:** If the problem involves multiple triangles, establish relationships between the unknowns in different triangles to solve simultaneously.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Think Tan First:** In most problems, using $\tan \theta$ directly relates height and distance.
*   **Standard Angles:** Remember the trigonometric values for $30^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $60^\circ$. This will save time.
*   **Difference of Distances:** When an observer moves away from an object, create variables for original distances and use difference in equations.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrect Diagram:** An inaccurate diagram leads to wrong equations. Pay close attention to angles and positions.
*   **Unit Consistency:** Ensure all measurements are in the same units before applying formulas.
*   **Angle of Depression vs. Angle of Elevation:** Remember that the angle of depression is measured *down* from the horizontal.
