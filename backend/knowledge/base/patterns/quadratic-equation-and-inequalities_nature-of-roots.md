# Quadratic Equation And Inequalities: Nature Of Roots

**JEE Frequency**: 10 years | **Questions**: 30

## Quadratic Equations & Inequalities: Nature of Roots - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency (10 Years):** High (30 Questions indicates significant importance)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Questions involving conditions on the roots of a quadratic equation (e.g., real, equal, distinct, imaginary, consecutive integers, lying in a given interval).
*   Problems asking for the range of a parameter based on the nature of roots.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Discriminant:**  $$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$
*   **Nature of Roots based on Discriminant:**
    *   If  $$\Delta > 0$$: Roots are real and distinct.
    *   If  $$\Delta = 0$$: Roots are real and equal (repeated).
    *   If  $$\Delta < 0$$: Roots are imaginary (complex conjugates).
*   **Sum and Product of Roots:**  For $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$,  $$\alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}$$, $$\alpha\beta = \frac{c}{a}$$
*   **Condition for roots to be of opposite sign:**  $$\frac{c}{a} < 0$$
*   **Condition for both roots positive:** $$\frac{-b}{a} > 0, \frac{c}{a} > 0, D \ge 0$$
*   **Condition for both roots negative:** $$\frac{-b}{a} < 0, \frac{c}{a} > 0, D \ge 0$$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify a, b, and c:**  Correctly identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation.
2.  **Apply the Discriminant:** Calculate $$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$.
3.  **Use Nature of Roots Conditions:** Relate the discriminant to the given conditions (real, equal, imaginary, etc.). Formulate an equation or inequality.
4.  **Utilize Sum and Product of Roots:** If relationships between roots are given (e.g., difference, ratio), use  $$\alpha + \beta$$ and $$\alpha\beta$$ to create additional equations.
5.  **Solve for the Unknown(s):** Solve the resulting equations/inequalities to find the desired parameter range or value.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Integer Root Implication:** If the coefficients are integers and you're looking for integer roots, consider factors of the constant term.
*   **Perfect Square:** Recognize perfect square expressions in $$\Delta$$ calculations to simplify the analysis. If $$\Delta$$ is a perfect square, the roots are rational.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Coefficient Errors:** Incorrectly identifying the values of *a*, *b*, and *c* in the quadratic equation. Double-check signs!
*   **Ignoring Discriminant for Real Roots:** Remember to include the case $$\Delta = 0$$ when the problem asks for *real* roots (as equal roots are also real).
*   **Algebraic Errors:** Careless algebra during simplification and solving. Practice makes perfect.
*   **Not considering all the required conditions.**
