### Example 1 (Year: 2018)

**Question:**

Tangents drawn from the point ($$-$$8, 0) to the parabola y<sup>2</sup> = 8x touch the parabola at $$P$$ and $$Q.$$ If F is the focus of the parabola, then the area of the triangle PFQ (in sq. units) is equal to :

**Solution:**

Equation of the chord of contact PQ is given by : T=0 
<br><br>or T $$ \equiv $$ yy<sub>1</sub> $$-$$ 4(x + x<sub>1</sub>),  where (x<sub>1</sub>,  y<sub>1</sub><sub></sub>) $$ \equiv $$ ($$-$$8, 0)
<br><br>$$\therefore\,\,\,$$Equation becomes : x = 8
<br><br>&amp; chord  of contact  is x = 8
<br><br>$$\therefore\,\,\,$$ Coordinates of point  P and Q are (8, 8) and (8, $$-$$ 8) 
<br><br>and focus of the parabola is F (2, 0)
<br><br>$$\therefore\,\,\,$$ Area  of triangle  PQF = $${1 \over 2}$$ $$ \times $$  (8 $$-$$ 2) $$ \times $$  (8 + 8)  = 48 sq. units
