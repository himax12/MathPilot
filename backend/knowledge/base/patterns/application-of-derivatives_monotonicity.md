# Application Of Derivatives: Monotonicity

**JEE Frequency**: 12 years | **Questions**: 41

## Monotonicity: JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (12 years, 41 questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Problems involve determining intervals where a function is increasing, decreasing, or strictly monotonic (either increasing or decreasing).
*   Often involve trigonometric, polynomial, or inverse trigonometric functions.
*   May require determining the number of real roots based on monotonicity arguments.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   If $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$, then $f(x)$ is strictly increasing in $(a, b)$.
*   If $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$, then $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing in $(a, b)$.
*   If $f'(x) \ge 0$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$, then $f(x)$ is increasing in $(a, b)$.
*   If $f'(x) \le 0$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing in $(a, b)$.

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Find the derivative:** Calculate $f'(x)$.
2.  **Find critical points:** Determine the values of $x$ where $f'(x) = 0$ or $f'(x)$ is undefined.
3.  **Analyze the sign of $f'(x)$:**  Create a sign chart for $f'(x)$ using the critical points as boundaries.
4.  **Identify intervals of monotonicity:**
    *   $f'(x) > 0$: Increasing
    *   $f'(x) < 0$: Decreasing
    *   $f'(x) \geq 0$: Non-decreasing
    *   $f'(x) \leq 0$: Non-increasing
5.  **Consider the domain:** Always keep the function's domain in mind when determining the intervals.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Simplify before differentiating:**  Algebraic and trigonometric simplification often makes differentiation easier.
*   **Think about range for root counting:** Monotonicity can establish the number of roots. If $f(x)$ is strictly monotonic, then $f(x) = c$ has at most one root.
*   **Use substitution (if applicable):** For composite functions, substitution may simplify differentiation and analysis.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Forgetting the domain:** A function might appear increasing based on the derivative, but be undefined in certain intervals.
*   **Incorrect differentiation:** Double-check the differentiation, especially for trigonometric and composite functions.
*   **Equating $f'(x) \ge 0$ with strictly increasing:** $f'(x)$ can be zero at discrete points without affecting strict monotonicity. Remember strictly increasing requires $f'(x) > 0$.
