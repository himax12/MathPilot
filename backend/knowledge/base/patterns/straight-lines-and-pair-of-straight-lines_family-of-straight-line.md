### Example 1 (Year: 2019)

**Question:**

Consider the set of all lines px + qy + r = 0  such that 3p + 2q + 4r = 0.  Which one of the following statements
is true?


**Solution:**

Equation of lines;
<br><br>px + qy + r = 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . . (1)
<br><br>Also given 
<br><br>3p + 2q + 4r = 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . . . (2)
<br><br>divide equation (2) by 4, we get
<br><br>$${3 \over 4}P + {2 \over 4}q + r = 0$$ &nbsp;&nbsp;. . . . (3)
<br><br>By comparing (1) and (3) we get, 
<br><br>x = $${3 \over 4}$$ and y = $${2 \over 4}$$ = $${1 \over 2}$$
<br><br>For any value of p,q and r, the equation of set of lines will pan through  $$\left( {{3 \over 4},{1 \over 2}} \right)$$
