# Binomial Theorem: Problems Based On Binomial Co Efficient And Collection Of Binomial Co Efficient

**JEE Frequency**: 20 years | **Questions**: 95

## Binomial Theorem: Problems Based On Binomial Coefficients and Their Collection

**JEE Frequency (20 years):** High (95 Questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Questions involve binomial coefficients, often represented as $^nC_r$ or $C(n,r)$.
*   Sums involving binomial coefficients in series or specific arrangements (e.g., alternating signs, combinations with other terms).
*   Problems relating coefficients of certain terms in a binomial expansion.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Binomial Theorem:  $$(x + y)^n = \sum_{r=0}^n {^nC_r \, x^{n-r} y^r}$$
*   $^nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
*   $^nC_r = {^nC_{n-r}}$ (Symmetry Property)
*   $^nC_r + ^nC_{r-1} = {^{n+1}C_r}$ (Pascal's Identity)
*   Sum of all binomial coefficients:  $$\sum_{r=0}^n {^nC_r} = 2^n$$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify the Binomial Expansion:**  Recognize the form $(x+y)^n$ or manipulate the given expression to fit this form.
2.  **Apply the Binomial Theorem:** Expand the expression using the theorem and identify the coefficients of relevant terms.
3.  **Use Combinatorial Identities:** Apply Pascal's identity, symmetry property, or other known identities to simplify expressions involving binomial coefficients.
4.  **Manipulate the Summation:** For series problems, try to express the sum in a closed form using standard results or identities. Sometimes use differentiation or integration of binomial expansions.
5.  **Solve for the Unknown:** Use the given conditions or relationships to solve for the desired quantity.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Substitute x=1, x=-1, x=0:** Useful for finding sums or differences of binomial coefficients.
*   **Recognize common series:** Know standard sums like $\sum_{r=0}^n r \, ^nC_r = n2^{n-1}$ and $\sum_{r=0}^n \frac{^nC_r}{r+1} = \frac{2^{n+1}-1}{n+1}$.
*   **Differention and Integration :** Differentiating and integrating the expansion $$(1+x)^n$$ can generate useful results.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrectly applying Pascal's Identity:** Double-check the indices (n and r) before applying the identity.
*   **Forgetting to consider all terms:** When expanding, ensure you consider all terms within the summation limits.
*   **Ignoring signs in alternating series:**  Pay close attention to the sign of each term, especially in alternating series (e.g., with terms involving $(-1)^r$).
