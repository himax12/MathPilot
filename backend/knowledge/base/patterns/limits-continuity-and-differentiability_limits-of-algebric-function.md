**JEE Frequency**: 11 years | **Questions**: 37

## Limits of Algebraic Functions: JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** 11 years
**Question Count:** 37

This document focuses on the "Limits of Algebraic Functions" subtopic within the broader chapter of "Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability," specifically tailored for JEE preparation.

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Direct substitution results in an indeterminate form (e.g., 0/0, ∞/∞).
*   The expression involves algebraic functions (polynomials, radicals, rational functions).
*   Often involves finding limits using factorization, rationalization, or L'Hôpital's rule.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Standard Limit 1:**  $$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{x^n - a^n}{x - a} = na^{n-1}$$
*   **Standard Limit 2:**  $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$$  (Although primarily used for trig limits, related algebraic manipulations might be needed)
*   **L'Hôpital's Rule:** If $$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = 0$$ and $$\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$$ (or both limits are ±∞), then $$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$  (provided the latter limit exists).
*   **Algebraic Identities:** Mastering identities such as  $$a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$$ and $$a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$$ are crucial for simplification.

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Direct Substitution:** Always try direct substitution first. If it yields a determinate value, you're done.
2.  **Indeterminate Form Identification:** If direct substitution results in an indeterminate form (0/0, ∞/∞, ∞-∞, etc.), proceed to the next step.
3.  **Algebraic Manipulation:**
    *   **Factorization:** Factorize numerator and denominator to cancel common factors.
    *   **Rationalization:** If radicals are present, rationalize the numerator or denominator.
    *   **Simplification:** Combine fractions, simplify complex expressions.
4.  **Re-evaluate the Limit:** After simplification, re-evaluate the limit using direct substitution.
5.  **L'Hôpital's Rule (if applicable):** If after algebraic manipulation, the limit is still indeterminate, apply L'Hôpital's Rule.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Rationalizing Factor:** Remember the rationalizing factor for $$\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b}$$ is $$\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$$.
*   **Substitution:** For complex expressions, consider substituting a part of the expression to simplify the limit. e.g., substitute x = a + h and let h tend to zero.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrect Application of L'Hôpital's Rule:**  Ensure the limit is truly in indeterminate form before applying L'Hôpital's rule. Applying it when not necessary often leads to more complex calculations.
*   **Forgetting to Check for Indeterminate Form:** Always check for indeterminate forms before attempting any solution.
*   **Algebraic Errors:** Careless mistakes in factorization or rationalization can lead to incorrect answers.  Double-check your algebraic manipulations.
