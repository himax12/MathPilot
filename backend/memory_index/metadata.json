      "content": "### Solution\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\nWe are given three students, S\u2081, S\u2082, and S\u2083, and some probabilities related to their problem-solving abilities.  Specifically, we know the probability that at least one of them solves the problem (P(U)), the probability that S\u2081 solves it given that neither S\u2082 nor S\u2083 solves it (P(V)), and the probability that S\u2082 solves it and S\u2083 doesn't (P(W)). We want to find the probability that S\u2083 solves it (P(T)).\n\n**Approach:**\nWe will use the definitions of conditional probability and the given information to try and express P(T) or P(S\u2083) in terms of P(U), P(V), and P(W). We will carefully define events and their probabilities to avoid incorrect assumptions of independence.  If we are unable to express P(S3) uniquely in terms of P(U), P(V), and P(W), we will state that the solution cannot be determined with the given information.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define Events and Probabilities:**\n    *   U: At least one of S\u2081, S\u2082, and S\u2083 solves the problem.  P(U) is given.\n    *   V: S\u2081 solves it, given that neither S\u2082 nor S\u2083 solves it. Thus, V is the event (S\u2081 and not S\u2082 and not S\u2083)\n    *   W: S\u2082 solves it and S\u2083 doesn't.\n    *   T: S\u2083 solves it. We want to find P(T) = P(S\u2083).\n\n2. **Express given probabilities using event intersections/unions:**\n    * P(U) = P(S\u2081 or S\u2082 or S\u2083) = P(S\u2081) + P(S\u2082) + P(S\u2083) - P(S\u2081 and S\u2082) - P(S\u2081 and S\u2083) - P(S\u2082 and S\u2083) + P(S\u2081 and S\u2082 and S\u2083)\n    * P(V) = P(S\u2081 | not S\u2082 and not S\u2083) = P(S\u2081 and not S\u2082 and not S\u2083) / P(not S\u2082 and not S\u2083)\n    * P(W) = P(S\u2082 and not S\u2083)\n    * P(T) = P(S\u2083)\n\n3. **Analyze P(V) and P(W):**\n    * From P(V) = P(S\u2081 and not S\u2082 and not S\u2083) / P(not S\u2082 and not S\u2083), we get:\n      P(S\u2081 and not S\u2082 and not S\u2083) = P(V) * P(not S\u2082 and not S\u2083)\n    * From P(W) = P(S\u2082 and not S\u2083), we have a value for the probability of S\u2082 solving it AND S\u2083 NOT solving it.\n    * P(not S\u2082 and not S\u2083) = 1 - P(S\u2082 or S\u2083) = 1 - P(S\u2082) - P(S\u2083) + P(S\u2082 and S\u2083)\n\n4. **Express P(U) in terms of simpler probabilities.**\n   Let:\n   *  `a = P(S1 and not S2 and not S3)`\n   *  `b = P(S2 and not S1 and not S3)`\n   *  `c = P(S3 and not S1 and not S2)`\n   *  `d = P(S1 and S2 and not S3)`\n   *  `e = P(S1 and S3 and not S2)`\n   *  `f = P(S2 and S3 and not S1)`\n   *  `g = P(S1 and S2 and S3)`\n\n   Then:\n   *   `P(U) = a + b + c + d + e + f + g`\n   *   `P(V) = a / (1 - P(S2) - P(S3) + P(S2 and S3)) = a/(1-P(S2)-P(S3)+f+g)`\n   *   `P(W) = b + d`\n   *   `P(T) = P(S3) = c + e + f + g`\n\n   Also note: `P(S2) = b + d + f + g`, so `P(S2) = P(W) + f + g`\n\n5. **Substitute and simplify.**\n   From P(V), we have `a = P(V) * (1 - P(S2) - P(S3) + P(S2 and S3)) = P(V)*(1-P(S2)-P(S3)+f+g)`\n   Since `P(S2) = P(W)+f+g`, then `a = P(V) * (1 - P(W) - f - g - P(S3) + f + g) = P(V)*(1 - P(W) - P(S3))`\n\n   Therefore, P(U) = P(V) * (1 - P(W) - P(S3)) + P(W) + P(S3) + c + e + f + g -b-d-e-f-g\n   And since `P(T)= c+e+f+g`, we get `P(U) = P(V)*(1-P(W)-P(S3)) + P(W)+P(S3)+c`\n   Also, `P(T) = c+e+f+g=P(S3)` so `c=P(S3)-e-f-g`. Substituting into the P(U) equation gives:\n   `p_u= p_v(1-p_w-p_s3)+p_w+p_s3+p_s3-e-f-g`\n\n6. **Check for Uniqueness:**\nNotice that the equation for P(U) in terms of P(V), P(W), and P(T)=P(S\u2083)  still contains `e`,`f`,`g` which is indeterminate using the given information. Therefore we cannot uniquely solve for P(T). We do not have enough independent equations.\n\n**Key Formulas/Concepts:**\n\n*   Conditional Probability: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n*   Total Probability\n*   Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n\n**Final Answer:**\nCannot determine P(T) uniquely with the given information.\n\n---\n\n**Internal Code** (for verification):\n\n**Answer:** Cannot determine P(T) uniquely with the given information.\n\n*Verified in 2 attempts (Reflexion Active).*",

A second line is perpendicular to the first and passes through the midpoint of the chord AB, intersecting the circle at C and D.  We need to find the area of the quadrilateral ADBC.\n\n**Approach:**\nThe quadrilateral ADBC is a rhombus.  The area of a rhombus is half the product of its diagonals.  One diagonal is the chord AB, and the other is the diameter CD.  We need to find the lengths of AB and CD.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n1. **Find the midpoint of AB:**\n   The midpoint M of AB lies on the line x + y = 1. Since the line CD is perpendicular to AB and passes through M, the line CD also passes through the origin (0,0), which is the center of the circle.  We can prove this using coordinate geometry, but it's also intuitive since the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center.\n\n2. **Recognize the Shape:**\n   ADBC is a rhombus. This is because the diagonals AB and CD bisect each other at right angles.\n\n3. **Calculate CD:**\n   Since CD passes through the origin (0,0), it's a diameter of the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 4.  Therefore, the radius is 2, and CD = 2 * radius = 4.\n\n4. **Calculate the distance from the origin to the line AB:**\n   The distance from the origin (0,0) to the line x + y = 1 is given by the formula:\n   distance = |Ax + By + C| / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2)\n   In this case, A = 1, B = 1, C = -1, x = 0, and y = 0.\n   distance = |1*0 + 1*0 - 1| / sqrt(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = |-1| / sqrt(2) = 1 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) / 2. This is the distance OM.\n\n5. **Calculate AM (half of AB):**\n   Consider the right triangle OMA, where O is the origin (center of the circle), M is the midpoint of AB, and A is a point on the circle and line.  We know OA = radius = 2, and OM = sqrt(2)/2. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   AM\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 - OM\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 - (sqrt(2)/2)\u00b2 = 4 - 2/4 = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2\n   AM = sqrt(7/2)\n\n6. **Calculate AB:**\n   Since M is the midpoint of AB, AB = 2 * AM = 2 * sqrt(7/2) = sqrt(4 * 7/2) = sqrt(14).\n\n7. **Calculate the Area of Rhombus ADBC:**\n   Area = (1/2) * AB * CD = (1/2) * sqrt(14) * 4 = 2 * sqrt(14).\n\n**Key Formulas/Concepts:**\n- Distance from a point to a line: |Ax + By + C| / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2)\n- Pythagorean Theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n- Area of a rhombus: (1/2) * d1 * d2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe area of the quadrilateral ADBC is **2*sqrt(14)**.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:** 2.0*sqrt(14)\n\n*Verified in 2 attempts (Reflexion Active).*",

We'll also use the fact that $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} = 1$ and $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\tan x}{x} = 1$.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n1. **Taylor series expansions:**\n   - $\\sin(x) = x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - ...$\n   - $\\tan(x) = x + \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{2x^5}{15} + ...$\n\n2. **Expanding $\\sin(\\sin(x))$:**\n   $\\sin(\\sin(x)) = \\sin(x) - \\frac{\\sin^3(x)}{6} + O(x^5) = (x - \\frac{x^3}{6} + ...) - \\frac{(x - \\frac{x^3}{6} + ...)^3}{6} + O(x^5) = x - \\frac{x^3}{6} - \\frac{x^3}{6} + O(x^5) = x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + O(x^5)$\n\n3. **Expanding $\\tan(\\tan(x))$:**\n   $\\tan(\\tan(x)) = \\tan(x) + \\frac{\\tan^3(x)}{3} + O(x^5) = (x + \\frac{x^3}{3} + ...) + \\frac{(x + \\frac{x^3}{3} + ...)^3}{3} + O(x^5) = x + \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^3}{3} + O(x^5) = x + \\frac{2x^3}{3} + O(x^5)$\n\n4. **Expanding $\\tan(x) - \\sin(x)$:**\n   $\\tan(x) - \\sin(x) = (x + \\frac{x^3}{3} + ...) - (x - \\frac{x^3}{6} + ...) = \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^3}{6} + O(x^5) = \\frac{x^3}{2} + O(x^5)$\n\n5. **Substituting the expansions into the limit:**\n   $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\tan(\\tan(x)) - \\sin(\\sin(x))}{\\tan(x) - \\sin(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{(x + \\frac{2x^3}{3} + O(x^5)) - (x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + O(x^5))}{\\frac{x^3}{2} + O(x^5)} = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{x^3 + O(x^5)}{\\frac{x^3}{2} + O(x^5)} = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{x^3(1 + O(x^2))}{x^3(\\frac{1}{2} + O(x^2))} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2$\n\nSince f(x) is continuous at x=0, we have $f(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = 2$.\n\n**Key Formulas/Concepts:**\n- Taylor series expansions of $\\sin(x)$ and $\\tan(x)$ around $x=0$.\n- Definition of continuity at a point.\n- Limit properties.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe value of f(0) is **2**.\n\n**Answer:** 2\n\n",

The roots of the equation, \u03b1\u209c and \u03b2\u209c, also depend on 't'. We are asked to find the value of 72(a + b)\u00b2, where 'a' is the limit of \u03b1\u209c as t approaches -1 from the right, and 'b' is the limit of \u03b2\u209c as t approaches -1 from the right.\n\n**Approach:**\nFirst, we'll use the relationship between the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation to find an expression for the sum of the roots, \u03b1\u209c + \u03b2\u209c, in terms of 't'. Then, we will find the limit of this sum as t approaches -1 from the right, which will give us a + b. Finally, we'll compute 72(a + b)\u00b2.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation:**\n   The quadratic equation is given by:\n   ((t + 2)^(1/7) \u2013 1)x\u00b2 + ((t + 2)^(1/6) \u2013 1)x + ((t + 2)^(1/21) \u2013 1) = 0\n   Here,\n   a = (t + 2)^(1/7) \u2013 1\n   b = (t + 2)^(1/6) \u2013 1\n   c = (t + 2)^(1/21) \u2013 1\n\n2. **Find the sum of the roots:**\n   The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 is given by -b/a. Therefore,\n   \u03b1\u209c + \u03b2\u209c = -((t + 2)^(1/6) \u2013 1) / ((t + 2)^(1/7) \u2013 1)\n\n3. **Find the limit of the sum of the roots as t approaches -1 from the right:**\n   We want to find lim (t\u2192-1\u207a) [\u03b1\u209c + \u03b2\u209c] = lim (t\u2192-1\u207a) [-((t + 2)^(1/6) \u2013 1) / ((t + 2)^(1/7) \u2013 1)]\n   Let u = t + 1, then as t\u2192-1\u207a, u\u21920\u207a.  So t = u - 1, and t + 2 = u + 1\n   lim (u\u21920\u207a) [-((u + 1)^(1/6) \u2013 1) / ((u + 1)^(1/7) \u2013 1)]\n   This limit is in the indeterminate form 0/0. We can use L'Hopital's rule:\n\n   lim (u\u21920\u207a) [-((1/6)(u + 1)^(-5/6)) / ((1/7)(u + 1)^(-6/7))]\n   = -(1/6) / (1/7) = -7/6\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the approximation (1+x)^n \u2248 1 + nx for small x.\n   lim (u\u21920\u207a) [-((1 + (1/6)u) \u2013 1) / ((1 + (1/7)u) \u2013 1)] = lim (u\u21920\u207a) [-(u/6) / (u/7)] = -7/6\n   Thus, a + b = -7/6\n\n4. **Calculate 72(a + b)\u00b2:**\n   72(a + b)\u00b2 = 72(-7/6)\u00b2 = 72 * (49/36) = 2 * 49 = 98\n\n**Key Formulas/Concepts:**\n- Sum of roots of quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 is -b/a\n- L'Hopital's Rule: If lim (x\u2192a) f(x)/g(x) is in indeterminate form 0/0 or \u221e/\u221e, then lim (x\u2192a) f(x)/g(x) = lim (x\u2192a) f'(x)/g'(x)\n- Approximation: (1+x)^n \u2248 1 + nx, for small x\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe value of 72(a + b)\u00b2 is **98**.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:** 98\n\n",
