# Limits Continuity And Differentiability: Limits Of Trigonometric Functions

**JEE Frequency**: 17 years | **Questions**: 58

## Limits of Trigonometric Functions: JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (17 years, 58 questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Presence of trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.) within a limit.
*   Argument of the trigonometric function often approaches 0 or a specific value (e.g., $\pi/2$).
*   Indeterminate forms like 0/0 or $\infty/\infty$ requiring simplification.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$$
*   $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\tan x}{x} = 1$$
*   $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}$$
*   $$\lim_{x \to 0} (1 + x)^{1/x} = e$$
*   Trigonometric Identities (e.g., $\sin 2x = 2 \sin x \cos x$, $1 - \cos 2x = 2 \sin^2 x$, $\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}$)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify Indeterminate Form:** Check if the limit is of the form 0/0, $\infty/\infty$, etc.
2.  **Apply Trigonometric Identities:** Simplify the expression using trigonometric identities to bring it closer to known limits.
3.  **Substitution:** Substitute to create standard limit forms (e.g., if $x \to a$, substitute $h = x - a$ so $h \to 0$).
4.  **Manipulate Algebraically:** Multiply and divide by appropriate factors to obtain the standard limit forms.  Commonly used factors are x, angle in radians, or related trig functions.
5.  **Evaluate the Limit:** Apply the standard limit formulas to find the final answer.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Small Angle Approximation:** For $x \approx 0$, $\sin x \approx x$, $\tan x \approx x$, $1 - \cos x \approx x^2/2$ (use with caution).
*   **L'Hopital's Rule:** When applicable (0/0 or $\infty/\infty$ form), differentiate the numerator and denominator separately and re-evaluate the limit.  Especially helpful when algebraic manipulation is complex.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrectly Applying Trigonometric Identities:** Ensure the identities are applied correctly and in the right context.
*   **Ignoring the Limit Condition:** Failing to recognize what the variable *actually* approaches; Incorrectly assuming x-> 0 always.
*   **Applying L'Hopital's Rule when not applicable:** Check that the indeterminate form is present *before* differentiation. For example, don't use L'Hopital's Rule if the denominator is not tending to zero.
