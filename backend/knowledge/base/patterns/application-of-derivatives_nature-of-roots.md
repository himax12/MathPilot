### Example 1 (Year: 2013)

**Question:**

The real number $$k$$ for which the equation, $$2{x^3} + 3x + k = 0$$ has two distinct real roots in $$\left[ {0,\,1} \right]$$ 

**Solution:**

$$f\left( x \right) = 2{x^3} + 3x + k$$
<br><br>$$f'\left( x \right) = 6{x^2} + 3 &gt; 0$$
<br><br>$$\forall x \in R$$ $$\,\,\,\,\,\,$$ (as $$\,\,\,\,\,\,$$ $${x^2} &gt; 0$$)
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow f\left( x \right)$$ is strictly increasing function
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow f\left( x \right) = 0$$ has only one real root, so two roots are not possible.
