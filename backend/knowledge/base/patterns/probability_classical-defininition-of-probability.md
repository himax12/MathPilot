# Probability: Classical Defininition Of Probability

**JEE Frequency**: 12 years | **Questions**: 49

## Probability: Classical Definition - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (12 Years, 49 Questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Problems involving equally likely outcomes: Dice rolls, card draws, coin tosses, random selections from a well-defined population.
*   Questions asking for "probability of an event" where the sample space and favorable outcomes can be explicitly counted.
*   Keywords like "at random," "fair," "unbiased," or descriptions implying each outcome has equal chance.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Probability of an Event:** \(P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes favorable to A}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}\)
*   **Probability of A or B:** \(P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\)
*   **Probability of Complement:** \(P(A') = 1 - P(A)\)
*   **If A and B are Mutually Exclusive:** \(P(A \cap B) = 0\)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Define Sample Space (S):** Identify all possible outcomes of the experiment. Determine \(n(S)\), the total number of possible outcomes.
2.  **Define Event (A):** Clearly define the event whose probability you need to calculate.
3.  **Count Favorable Outcomes:** Determine \(n(A)\), the number of outcomes that satisfy the conditions of the event A. Combinations/Permutations are frequently needed.
4.  **Calculate Probability:**  Apply the formula \(P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}\).
5.  **Simplify:**  Simplify the fraction to obtain the final answer.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Use Complementary Probability:**  If calculating \(P(A)\) is difficult, try calculating \(P(A')\) and then use \(P(A) = 1 - P(A')\).  Especially helpful for "at least" type questions.
*   **Break Down Complex Events:** Decompose a complex event into simpler, mutually exclusive events and calculate their probabilities separately, then add them up if required.
*   **Careful Counting:** Pay close attention to wording such as "without replacement" or "with replacement". They heavily impact the value of n(S) and n(A).

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Unequal Likelihood:** Assuming all outcomes are equally likely when they are not.  The classical definition only applies to equiprobable events.
*   **Incorrect Counting:**  Making errors in counting favorable outcomes or total outcomes. Double-check your combinations and permutations. Especially avoid double counting outcomes!
*   **Overlapping Events:** Forgetting to subtract \(P(A \cap B)\) when calculating \(P(A \cup B)\) when A and B are not mutually exclusive.
