# Functions: Domain

**JEE Frequency**: 10 years | **Questions**: 22

## Knowledge Base: Functions - Domain (JEE)

**JEE Frequency:** 10 years
**Question Count:** 22

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   The question asks for the set of all possible *x* values for which the given function *f(x)* produces a real number output.
*   Functions involving combinations of:
    *   Square roots
    *   Logarithms
    *   Inverse trigonometric functions
    *   Rational functions (fractions)
    *   Modulus functions

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Square root: $$\sqrt{f(x)}$$ requires $$f(x) \ge 0$$
*   Logarithm: $${\log_b f(x)}$$ requires $$f(x) > 0$$ and $$b > 0, b \ne 1$$
*   Inverse Sine: $${\sin^{-1} f(x)}$$ requires $$-1 \le f(x) \le 1$$
*   Inverse Cosine: $${\cos^{-1} f(x)}$$ requires $$-1 \le f(x) \le 1$$
*   Rational Function: $$\frac{1}{f(x)}$$ requires $$f(x) \ne 0$$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  Identify all function types present in the given function *f(x)*.
2.  Apply the corresponding domain restrictions to each function type.  Create inequalities based on these restrictions.
3.  Solve the inequalities obtained in Step 2.
4.  Find the intersection of all the solution sets obtained in Step 3. This intersection represents the domain of the overall function.
5.  Express the final domain in interval notation.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Sketching:** Quickly sketch the function inside inverse trigonometric or logarithmic functions. This can often help visualize the range and the domain restriction.
*   **Interval Testing:** If the inequality is complex, test values from different intervals determined by critical points to check validity.
*   **Consider the overall form:** Sometimes the function is defined piecewise, and the domain must be carefully constructed considering the entire function.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Forgetting restrictions:**  Missing the condition for the base of a logarithm (b > 0, b ≠ 1) or forgetting to consider the denominator in rational functions.
*   **Incorrect Inequality Sign:** Reversing the inequality sign during the solution process, particularly when multiplying by a negative number.
*   **Union vs. Intersection:** Using the union instead of the intersection of solution sets when dealing with multiple domain restrictions.  The *domain* must satisfy *all* conditions simultaneously.
