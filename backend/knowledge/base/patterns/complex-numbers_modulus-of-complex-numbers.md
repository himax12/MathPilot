# Complex Numbers: Modulus Of Complex Numbers

**JEE Frequency**: 12 years | **Questions**: 30

## Complex Numbers: Modulus - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** 12 years
**Question Count:** ~30

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Equations involving `|z|`, `|z-a|`, or expressions relating `|f(z)|` to `|z|`. Often involves geometric interpretation (circles, lines).
*   Problems asking for locus, maximum/minimum values, or number of solutions when modulus conditions are given.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   `|z| = sqrt(Re(z)^2 + Im(z)^2)` where `z = Re(z) + i Im(z)`
*   `|z_1 * z_2| = |z_1| * |z_2|`
*   `|z_1 / z_2| = |z_1| / |z_2|`
*   `|z|^2 = z * conjugate(z)` where `conjugate(z) = Re(z) - i Im(z)`
*   Triangle Inequality: `|z_1 + z_2| <= |z_1| + |z_2|` and `|z_1 - z_2| >= ||z_1| - |z_2||`

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Substitution:** Let `z = x + iy`.  Substitute into the given equation(s).
2.  **Simplify:**  Simplify the expression inside the modulus using algebraic manipulations.
3.  **Evaluate Modulus:** Use `|x + iy| = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` to convert the complex equation into a real equation.
4.  **Identify Locus:**  Identify the curve (circle, line, ellipse, etc.) represented by the resulting equation in `x` and `y`.
5.  **Solve for Max/Min:**  Use the geometric interpretation or calculus to find the required maximum/minimum value.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Geometric Interpretation:** `|z - a| = r` represents a circle centered at `a` with radius `r`. `|z - a| = |z - b|` represents the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining `a` and `b`.
*   **Unimodular shortcut:** If |z| = 1, then `z * conjugate(z) = 1` and `conjugate(z) = 1/z`
*   **Homogenization:** When dealing with ratios and modulus equations, look for opportunities to homogenize (make the degree of each term the same).

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Squaring prematurely:** Squaring modulus equations can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions.  Verify your answers.
*   **Incorrectly applying Triangle Inequality:** Remember to consider both `|z_1 + z_2| <= |z_1| + |z_2|`  and `|z_1 - z_2| >= ||z_1| - |z_2||` to find the maximum and minimum values respectively.
*   **Forgetting Geometric Interpretation:** Always try to visualize the problem geometrically. This can significantly simplify the solution.
