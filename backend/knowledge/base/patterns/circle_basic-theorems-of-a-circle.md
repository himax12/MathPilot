# Circle: Basic Theorems Of A Circle

**JEE Frequency**: 12 years | **Questions**: 28

## Circle: Basic Theorems - Knowledge Base (JEE)

**JEE Frequency:** 12 years
**Question Count:** 28 questions

This document summarizes key concepts and strategies for tackling problems related to basic circle theorems in the JEE exam.

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Problems frequently involve finding the equation of a circle given certain conditions (e.g., passing through points, center location, tangent lines).
*   Questions often link circle properties to geometric figures like triangles, quadrilaterals, and lines.
*   Locus problems relating to circles are also common.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Equation of a Circle (Standard Form):** $$(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$$, where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.
*   **Equation of a Circle (General Form):** $$x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$$, where center is (-g, -f) and radius is $$\sqrt{g^2 + f^2 - c}$$.
*   **Parametric Form:**  $$x = h + r\cos\theta, y = k + r\sin\theta$$
*   **Distance Formula:** $$d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify Given Information:**  Clearly state the knowns (center, radius, points on the circle, geometric properties).
2.  **Apply Relevant Theorems/Formulas:** Choose the appropriate formula based on the given information. If using the general form, calculate `g`, `f`, and `c`.
3.  **Solve for Unknowns:** Set up equations using the given information and the chosen formulas. Solve for the unknown parameters (center coordinates, radius, equation coefficients).
4.  **Verify Solution:**  Substitute the obtained solution back into the original conditions to ensure consistency.
5.  **For Locus Problems:** Find a relationship between the moving point (h, k) and fixed values. Replace (h, k) with (x, y) to find the locus equation.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Diametric Form:**  If the endpoints of a diameter are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the circle equation is $$(x - x_1)(x - x_2) + (y - y_1)(y - y_2) = 0$$.  This is useful to quickly find the circle passing through two points lying across the center.
*   **Angle in a Semicircle:** Remember that the angle inscribed in a semicircle is always 90 degrees.
*   **Cyclic Quadrilaterals:** The sum of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is 180 degrees. Use properties like Ptolemy's theorem when appropriate.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrectly determining the center and radius:**  Careless algebraic errors when completing the square or simplifying equations can lead to wrong answers. Double-check your calculations.
*   **Forgetting to square the radius:** When using the distance formula to find the radius, remember to square the result to get $$r^2$$ for the circle equation.
*   **Confusing general and standard forms:** Ensure you are using the correct form of the circle equation for the given problem. Convert to the appropriate form if needed.
