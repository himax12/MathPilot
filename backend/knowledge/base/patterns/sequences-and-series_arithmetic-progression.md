# Sequences And Series: Arithmetic Progression

**JEE Frequency**: 15 years | **Questions**: 82

## Arithmetic Progression (AP) - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (82 Questions in 15 years)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Constant difference between consecutive terms is the hallmark of an AP.  Look for phrases like "evenly spaced," "increases by a fixed amount," or "decreases by a fixed amount."
*   Problems involving sums of series, finding specific terms given other terms or sums, or relationships between terms (like forming APs with logarithms).

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   nth term:  $$a_n = a + (n-1)d$$  where *a* is the first term and *d* is the common difference.
*   Sum of n terms: $$S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d] = \frac{n}{2}[a + l]$$ where *l* is the last term.
*   Arithmetic Mean (AM) between *a* and *b*: $$AM = \frac{a+b}{2}$$  (If *a*, *b*, *c* are in AP, then *b* = (a+c)/2)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify a and d:** Clearly define the first term (*a*) and the common difference (*d*).  Sometimes these are directly given; other times, you'll need to derive them from the problem statement.
2.  **Express relevant terms:** Write out the expressions for the terms involved in the question using  `a_n = a + (n-1)d`.
3.  **Formulate Equations:** Based on the given information (e.g., sum of terms, a relationship between terms), create equations.
4.  **Solve for unknowns:** Solve the equations simultaneously to find the required variables (usually *a*, *d*, or *n*).
5.  **Substitute & Verify:** Substitute the obtained values to find the answer and, if time permits, verify that your solution satisfies the original problem conditions.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Assume and Check:** If possible, assume values for *a* and *d* that satisfy given conditions and check if the answer matches any of the options. (Use judiciously; best for quick elimination).
*   **Reverse the Series:**  In some summation problems, reversing the order of terms and adding the two series can simplify calculations.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrectly Identifying a and d:**  Double-check which term is the *first* term and the *common* difference.
*   **Algebraic Errors:**  Be extremely careful with algebraic manipulations, especially when solving simultaneous equations.  Errors in sign and arithmetic are common pitfalls.
*   **Forgetting the Basic Formula:** Ensure that you remember the sum and term formulas for APs.
