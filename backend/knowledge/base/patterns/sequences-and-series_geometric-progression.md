# Sequences And Series: Geometric Progression

**JEE Frequency**: 13 years | **Questions**: 56

## Geometric Progression: JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (13 years, 56 questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Terms follow a multiplicative pattern: Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor (common ratio). Look for this constant ratio.
*   Problems often involve relationships between terms, sums of terms, or products of terms.
*   Word problems involving growth or decay can often be modeled using GPs.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **nth term:**  `$a_n = ar^{n-1}$` (where `a` is the first term, `r` is the common ratio)
*   **Sum of n terms:**  `$S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$` (if `r ≠ 1`)
*   **Sum of infinite terms:** `$S_\infty = \frac{a}{1-r}$` (if `|r| < 1`)
*   **Geometric Mean (GM) between a and b:** `$\sqrt{ab}$` ( useful in problems involving 3 terms in GP)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify:** Determine if the given sequence is a GP by checking if the ratio between consecutive terms is constant.
2.  **Express:** Express all given information in terms of `a` and `r`.
3.  **Solve:** Formulate equations based on the problem statement and solve for `a` and `r`.
4.  **Substitute:** Substitute the values of `a` and `r` back into the required expression (e.g., finding a specific term or sum).
5.  **Check:** Verify your answer satisfies the given conditions.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Logarithmic Transformation:** If terms of a GP are given, taking logarithms can transform the GP into an AP, which can simplify calculations (as seen in Q1).
*   **Infinite GP:** Remember the condition `|r| < 1` for the sum to infinity to exist. Ensure this condition is met.  If not, S_infinity DNE (Does Not Exist).

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Forgetting |r| < 1:**  Applying the formula for `$S_\infty$` when `|r| ≥ 1`.
*   **Incorrectly identifying a and r:** Carefully identify the first term and common ratio, especially when the problem is worded indirectly.
*   **Algebraic errors:** Be meticulous with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with powers and fractions.
