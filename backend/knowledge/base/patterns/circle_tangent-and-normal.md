# Circle: Tangent And Normal

**JEE Frequency**: 10 years | **Questions**: 33

## Circle: Tangent and Normal (JEE Knowledge Base)

**JEE Frequency:** High (Tangent and Normal are fundamental concepts frequently tested)
**Question Count (10 years):** 33

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Questions often involve finding the equation of tangent/normal given a point on the circle or conditions like touching a curve/line.
*   Problems frequently involve circles touching other circles or lines (including coordinate axes).
*   Optimization problems related to minimizing/maximizing areas or lengths involving tangents are also common.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   **Tangent at a point (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) on x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>:**  $$xx_1 + yy_1 = a^2$$
*   **Tangent at a point (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) on (x-h)<sup>2</sup> + (y-k)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>:** $$(x-h)(x_1-h) + (y-k)(y_1-k) = a^2$$
*   **Normal at a point (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) on a circle always passes through the center (h, k):**  Equation:  $$(y-y_1) = \frac{y_1-k}{x_1-h}(x-x_1)$$
*   **Condition for y = mx + c to be a tangent to x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>:**  $$c^2 = a^2(1 + m^2)$$
*   **Length of Tangent from (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) to x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0:**  $$ \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2 + 2gx_1 + 2fy_1 + c}$$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify the circle:** Find the center and radius if not directly given.  Complete the square if necessary.
2.  **Determine point of tangency:** Verify the point lies on the circle.
3.  **Apply the appropriate tangent equation:** Use the formula relevant to the given circle equation.
4.  **For normal:**  Calculate the slope of the radius (connecting center and point). Normal's slope is the negative reciprocal.
5.  **Use additional conditions:** Apply any given conditions (e.g., tangent touching another curve, length of chord) to solve for unknowns.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Parametric form:** Use the parametric form of the circle (x = h + r cos θ, y = k + r sin θ) to simplify calculations in some problems, especially involving lengths or areas.
*   **Family of Circles:** If the circle passes through the intersection of two lines, use the family of circles equation.
*   **Common Tangents:** When two circles touch, the point of tangency divides the line joining their centers in the ratio of their radii internally or externally.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrectly applying the tangent formula:** Ensure you're using the correct formula for the type of circle equation (standard form vs. general form).
*   **Not checking if the point lies on the circle:**  Always verify the point of tangency actually lies on the circle.
*   **Sign errors:** Be careful with signs, especially when finding the slope of the normal or applying the distance formula.
