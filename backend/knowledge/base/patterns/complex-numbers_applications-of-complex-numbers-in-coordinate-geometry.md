**JEE Frequency**: 13 years | **Questions**: 51

## Complex Numbers: Applications in Coordinate Geometry - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** 13 years
**Question Count:** 51 questions

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   **Geometric Interpretation:** Questions often involve circles, lines, triangles, and other geometric shapes represented using complex numbers. Look for modulus (distance), argument (angle), and equations of the form $|z-a| = r$.
*   **Locus Problems:**  The question asks for the path traced by a complex number satisfying certain geometric conditions.  This usually involves expressing z as x + iy and eliminating parameters to get a Cartesian equation.
*   **Relationship between complex roots & geometry:** If roots of a quadratic equation are complex, the problem may involve geometric properties of the triangle formed by these roots in the argand plane.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Distance between points $z_1$ and $z_2$:  $|z_1 - z_2|$
*   Equation of a circle with center $z_0$ and radius $r$: $|z - z_0| = r$
*   Equation of a line passing through $z_1$ and $z_2$:  $\arg\left(\frac{z - z_1}{z_2 - z_1}\right) = 0$ or $\pi$. Alternative form: $\bar{a}z + a\bar{z} + b = 0$ where $a$ is a complex number and $b$ is real.
*   Rotation by $\theta$ about a point $z_0$: $z' = z_0 + e^{i\theta}(z - z_0)$
*   Section Formula: If z divides the join of $z_1$ and $z_2$ in the ratio m:n, then $z = \frac{mz_2 + nz_1}{m+n}$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Translate the Geometric Information:** Convert the given geometric conditions (e.g., distance, angle, collinearity, concurrency) into equations involving complex numbers and their moduli/arguments.
2.  **Express z as x + iy:** Substitute $z = x + iy$ into the equations obtained in step 1.
3.  **Simplify and Eliminate Parameters:**  Simplify the equations and eliminate any unwanted parameters to obtain a relationship between x and y. This relationship will be the equation of the locus or the desired geometric condition.
4.  **Use Properties of Modulus and Argument:** Utilize properties like $|z_1z_2| = |z_1||z_2|$,  $|z_1/z_2| = |z_1|/|z_2|$, and $\arg(z_1z_2) = \arg(z_1) + \arg(z_2)$ to simplify the equations.
5.  **Relate Equations:** Use the information about the problem to relate the equations found.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Triangle Inequality:** Remember the triangle inequality: $|z_1 + z_2| \leq |z_1| + |z_2|$ and $|z_1 - z_2| \geq ||z_1| - |z_2||$. This is crucial for maximum/minimum value problems.
*   **Complex Conjugate:** If an expression is purely real or purely imaginary, use the property that $z = \bar{z}$ (real) or $z = -\bar{z}$ (imaginary) respectively.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrectly applying Triangle Inequality:**  Pay close attention to the direction of the inequality.
*   **Ignoring Geometric Constraints:**  Always consider the restrictions on the complex number, like $z \neq 1$, which might affect the final answer.
*   **Messy Algebra:**  Careless algebraic manipulation can lead to incorrect results. Keep your work organized and double-check each step.
