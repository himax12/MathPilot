# Quadratic Equation And Inequalities: Relation Between Roots And Coefficients

**JEE Frequency**: 19 years | **Questions**: 80

## Quadratic Equations: Relation Between Roots and Coefficients - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (19 years, 80 questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   The question directly asks for a relation between the roots (α, β) and the coefficients (a, b, c) of a quadratic equation.  Look for phrases like "roots are", "sum of roots", "product of roots", or equations involving roots with coefficients.
*   The question often involves forming a new quadratic equation with roots derived from the original roots (e.g., α/β, α<sup>2</sup>, α+1).

**2. Core Formulas:**

Let the quadratic equation be  \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and its roots be α and β. Then:

*   Sum of roots:  \(\alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}\)
*   Product of roots: \(\alpha \beta = \frac{c}{a}\)
*   Difference of roots: \(|\alpha - \beta| = \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{|a|}\)
*   Equation with roots α and β: \(x^2 - (\alpha + \beta)x + \alpha\beta = 0\)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify Coefficients:**  Extract a, b, and c from the given quadratic equation(s).
2.  **Apply Formulas:** Use the core formulas to express sum, product, and/or difference of roots in terms of a, b, and c.
3.  **Manipulate Equations:**  Formulate equations based on the given condition (e.g., α = 2β, α + β = α<sup>2</sup> + β<sup>2</sup>).
4.  **Solve for Unknowns:** Solve the system of equations to find the required value or relation.
5.  **Form New Equation (if needed):** If the problem asks for a new quadratic, calculate the sum and product of the new roots and use the formula \(x^2 - (\text{sum of new roots})x + (\text{product of new roots}) = 0\).

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Symmetric Expressions:**  Often, questions involve symmetric expressions in α and β (e.g., α<sup>2</sup> + β<sup>2</sup>, α<sup>3</sup> + β<sup>3</sup>). Express these using  \((\alpha + \beta)\) and \((\alpha\beta)\) to simplify.  Remember:  \(\alpha^2 + \beta^2 = (\alpha + \beta)^2 - 2\alpha\beta\)
*   **Root Transformation:** If roots are transformed (e.g., roots are α+1, β+1), find the sum and product of these *transformed* roots.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Sign Errors:**  Carefully note the negative sign in  \(\alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}\). This is a frequent source of error.
*   **Coefficient 'a':** Don't forget to divide by 'a' when applying the formulas.  Many incorrectly use -b/1 instead of -b/a.
*   **Assuming Integer Roots:** Do not assume roots are integers unless explicitly stated. Use the quadratic formula when necessary.
