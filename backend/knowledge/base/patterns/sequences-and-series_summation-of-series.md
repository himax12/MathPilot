# Sequences And Series: Summation Of Series

**JEE Frequency**: 20 years | **Questions**: 109

## Sequences and Series: Summation of Series - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (109 Questions in 20 Years)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Look for recurring patterns in the terms (e.g., squares, cubes, factorials, alternating signs, fractions with increasing numerators/denominators).
*   Check if the series is Arithmetic Progression (AP), Geometric Progression (GP), Harmonic Progression (HP), or a combination/modification thereof.
*   Observe if the series can be expressed as a difference of two similar series (Method of Difference).

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Sum of first n natural numbers:  $$ \sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$
*   Sum of squares of first n natural numbers:  $$ \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} $$
*   Sum of cubes of first n natural numbers:  $$ \sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 $$
*   Sum of a GP:  $$ S_n = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r-1} $$ (where a is the first term and r is the common ratio)
*   Sum of infinite GP ( |r| < 1 ):  $$ S_\infty = \frac{a}{1-r} $$

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify the Pattern:**  Carefully observe the terms to determine the type of series.
2.  **Express the General Term (T<sub>n</sub>):** Find a formula for the nth term of the series.
3.  **Apply Appropriate Formula/Technique:** Use formulas for AP, GP, or special series like summation of squares/cubes.  For other series, try Method of Difference or Telescoping Series.
4.  **Simplify and Solve:**  Algebraically manipulate the expression to arrive at the final sum.
5.  **Check your answer:** If possible, substitute small values of 'n' and see if the calculated sum matches.

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Method of Difference:**  If the difference between consecutive terms forms an AP or GP, the series can often be solved using the method of difference.  Express T<sub>n</sub> = V<sub>n</sub> - V<sub>n-1</sub> and sum.
*   **Telescoping Series:** Aim to express the general term as a difference, so when you sum, terms cancel out, leaving only a few terms at the beginning and end.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Incorrectly Identifying the Series:**  Misidentifying the series type will lead to using the wrong formulas. Double-check the pattern.
*   **Missing the General Term:**  Failing to find the correct general term (T<sub>n</sub>) prevents you from applying summation techniques.
*   **Arithmetic Errors:** Careless arithmetic mistakes in simplification can lead to incorrect results.
