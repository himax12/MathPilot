# Ellipse: Question Based On Basic Definition And Parametric Representation

**JEE Frequency**: 16 years | **Questions**: 45

## Ellipse: Basic Definition & Parametric Representation - JEE Knowledge Base

**JEE Frequency:** High (16 years, 45 Questions)

**1. Pattern Recognition:**

*   Questions involve direct application of eccentricity, foci, directrix, and axis relationships.
*   Problems frequently require linking geometric properties (angles, distances) to ellipse parameters.
*   Parametric form is often used to simplify calculations involving points on the ellipse.

**2. Core Formulas:**

*   Eccentricity:  \(e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}}\) (where *a* is semi-major axis, *b* is semi-minor axis)
*   Foci:  \((\pm ae, 0)\)
*   Directrices: \(x = \pm \frac{a}{e}\)
*   Distance from a point to focus / directrix relationship:  \(SP = e \cdot PM\) (SP is the distance to focus, PM is distance to directrix)
*   Parametric Representation: \(x = a\cos\theta\), \(y = b\sin\theta\)

**3. Standard Approach:**

1.  **Identify Key Parameters:** Determine given values for *a*, *b*, *e*, foci, directrix, or any geometric constraint.
2.  **Apply Definition:** Use the definition of the ellipse (SP = e.PM) if distances to foci and directrix are involved.
3.  **Relate Parameters:** Connect given information with core formulas to establish relationships between *a*, *b*, and *e*.
4.  **Solve for Unknowns:** Solve the derived equations to find the required parameters or the equation of the ellipse.
5.  **Verify:** Ensure your solution aligns with given constraints (e.g., eccentricity range).

**4. Quick Tips:**

*   **Focus on Eccentricity:** Many problems hinge on finding or using the eccentricity correctly. Prioritize its calculation.
*   **Parametric Simplification:** Use the parametric form to represent points on the ellipse and simplify distance/angle calculations, especially when dealing with tangents or normals.

**5. Common Mistakes:**

*   **Confusing a and b:** Incorrectly assigning semi-major and semi-minor axes, especially when the ellipse is not in standard form.
*   **Sign Errors with Foci/Directrices:** Pay close attention to the sign of *ae* and *a/e* when dealing with foci and directrices.
*   **Incorrectly Applying SP=e.PM:** Not properly calculating the perpendicular distance (PM) to the directrix.
