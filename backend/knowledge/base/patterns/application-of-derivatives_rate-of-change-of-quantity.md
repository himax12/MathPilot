## Worked Examples

### Example 1 (Year: 2004)

**Question:**

A point on the parabola $${y^2} = 18x$$ at which the ordinate increases at twice the rate of the abscissa is 

**Solution:**

$${y^2} = 18x \Rightarrow 2y{{dy} \over {dx}} = 18 \Rightarrow {{dy} \over {dx}} = {9 \over y}$$
<br><br>Given $${{dy} \over {dx}} = 2 \Rightarrow {9 \over 2} = 2 \Rightarrow y = {9 \over 2}$$ 
<br><br>Puting in $${y^2} = 18x \Rightarrow x = {9 \over 8}$$
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ Required point is $$\left( {{9 \over 8},{9 \over 2}} \right)$$

### Example 2 (Year: 2005)

**Question:**

A spherical iron ball $$10$$ cm in radius is coated with a layer of ice of uniform thickness that melts at a rate of $$50$$ cm$$^3$$ /min. When the thickness of ice is $$5$$ cm, then the rate at which the thickness of ice decreases is 
 

**Solution:**

Given that
<br><br>$${{dv} \over {dt}} = 50\,c{m^3}/\min $$
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow {d \over {dt}}\left( {{4 \over 3}\pi {r^3}} \right) = 50$$
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow 4\pi {r^2}{{dr} \over {dt}} = 50$$
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow {{dr} \over {dt}} = {{50} \over {4\pi {{\left( {15} \right)}^2}}} = {1 \over {18\pi }}\,\,cm/\min \,\,$$
<br><br>(here $$r=10+5)$$ 

### Example 3 (Year: 2005)

**Question:**

A lizard, at an initial distance of 21 cm behind an insect moves from rest with an acceleration of $2 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}^2$ and pursues the insect which is crawling uniformly along a straight line at a speed of $20 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$. Then the lizard will catch the insect after :

**Solution:**

<p>The motion of the lizard, which starts from rest and accelerates at a rate of $a = 2 \, \text{cm/s}^2$, can be described by the equation of motion :</p>
<p>$D_l = \frac{1}{2} a t^2$</p>
<p>where $D_l$ is the distance the lizard travels, $a$ is its acceleration, and $t$ is the time.</p>
<p>The insect, moving at a constant speed of $v = 20 \, \text{cm/s}$, has a motion that can be simply described as:</p>
<p>$D_i = v t$</p>
<p>where $D_i$ is the distance the insect travels, $v$ is its velocity, and $t$ is the time.</p>
<p>Since the lizard starts 21 cm behind the insect and needs to catch up, it must travel the distance the insect travels plus an additional 21 cm. Equating these two distances gives us :</p>
<p>$\frac{1}{2} a t^2 = v t + 21$</p>
<p>Substituting the given values into this equation gives :</p>
<p>$t^2 = \frac{(v t + 21) \cdot 2}{a}$</p>
<p>Substituting $a = 2 \, \text{cm/s}^2$ and $v = 20 \, \text{cm/s}$, we simplify to :</p>
<p>$t^2 = 20t + 21$</p>
<p>This simplifies to ...

### Example 4 (Year: 2012)

**Question:**

A spherical balloon is filled with $$4500\pi $$ cubic meters of helium gas. If a leak in the balloon causes the gas to escape at the rate of $$72\pi $$ cubic meters per minute, then the rate (in meters per minute) at which the radius of the balloon decreases $$49$$ minutes after the leakage began is :

**Solution:**

Volume of spherical balloon $$ = V = {4 \over 3}\pi {r^3}$$
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow 4500\pi  = {{4\pi {r^3}} \over 3}$$ 
<br><br>( as Given, volume $$ = 4500\pi {m^3}$$ )
<br><br>Differentiating both the sides, $$w.r.t't'$$ we get, 
<br><br>$${{dV} \over {dt}} = 4\pi {r^2}\left( {{{dr} \over {dt}}} \right)$$
<br><br>Now, it is given that $${{dV} \over {dt}} = 72\pi $$
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ After $$49$$ min, Volume - 
<br><br>$$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \left( {4500 - 49 \times 72} \right)\pi $$
<br><br>$$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \left( {4500 - 3528} \right)\pi $$
<br><br>$$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = 972\pi {m^3}$$
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow V = 972\,\,\pi {m^3}$$
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ $$972\pi  = {4 \over 3}\pi r{}^3$$
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow {r^3} = 3 \times 243 = 3 \times {3^5} = {3^6} = {\left( {{3^2}} \right)^3} \Rightarrow r = 9$$
<br><br>Also, we have $${{dV} \over {dt}} = 72\pi $$
<br><br>$$\therefore$$ $$72\pi  = ...

### Example 5 (Year: 2019)

**Question:**

A 2 m ladder leans against a vertical wall. If the top of the ladder begins to slide down the wall at the rate
25 cm/sec, then the rate (in cm/sec.) at which the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall on the
horizontal ground when the top of the ladder is 1 m above the ground is : 

**Solution:**

x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 4 $$ \Rightarrow $$ $$2x{{dx} \over {dt}} + 2y{{dy} \over {dt}} = 0$$<br><br>
$$ \Rightarrow {{dx} \over {dt}} =  - {y \over x}.{{dy} \over {dt}}$$<br><br>
When upper end is 1m above the ground, $${{dx} \over {dt}} =  - {1 \over {\sqrt 3 }}.25 =  - {{25} \over {\sqrt 3 }}$$ cm/sec.
