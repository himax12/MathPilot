### Example 1 (Year: 2009)

**Question:**

If $A, B$ and $C$ are three sets such that $A \cap B=A \cap C$ and $A \cup B=A \cup C$, then :

**Solution:**

<p>From the given conditions, we have :</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A ∩ B = A ∩ C : The intersection of set A with set B is the same as the intersection of set A with set C. This indicates that all elements common to A and B are also common to A and C, and vice versa.</p>
</li>
<br/><li><p>A ∪ B = A ∪ C : The union of set A with set B is the same as the union of set A with set C. This indicates that all elements in A, B, and C are the same.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From these two conditions, we can infer that set B is equal to set C because every element of B is also an element of C and vice versa. Hence, <b>Option B :</b> B = C is the correct answer.</p>

### Example 2 (Year: 2019)

**Question:**

Let A, B and C be sets such that $$\phi $$ $$ \ne $$ A $$ \cap $$ B $$ \subseteq $$  C. Then which of the following statements is not true ?

**Solution:**

According to the question, we have the following Venn diagram.
<br><br>Here, $A \cap B \subseteq C$ and $A \cap B \neq \phi$

<br>Now, from the Venn diagram, it is clear that $B \cap C \neq \phi$, is true
<br><br>Also, $(C \cup A) \cap(C \cup B)=C \cup(A \cap B)=C$ is true.
<br><br>If $(A-B) \subseteq C$, for this statement the Venn diagram is

### Example 3 (Year: 2019)

**Question:**

Two newspapers A and B are published in a city.
It is known that 25% of the city populations reads
A and 20% reads B while 8% reads both A and
B. Further, 30% of those who read A but not B
look into advertisements and 40% of those who
read B but not A also look into advertisements,
while 50% of those who read both A and B look
into advertisements. Then the percentage of the
population who look into advertisement is :-

<p>The percentage of people who read newspaper A is given as 25. However, among these, there ar...

### Example 4 (Year: 2019)

**Question:**

In a class of 140 students numbered 1 to 140, all even numbered students opted Mathematics course, those whose number is divisible by 3 opted Physics course and those whose number is divisible by 5 opted Chemistry course. Then the number of students who did not opt for any of the three courses is 

**Solution:**

We're given that there are 140 students numbered from 1 to 140. 

<br/><br/>1. Define the set $A$ to be the set of even numbered students. The cardinality of $A$ (the number of elements in $A$), denoted as $n(A)$, can be computed as the greatest integer less than or equal to $140/2$. Hence, $n(A) = \left[\frac{140}{2}\right] = 70$. ([.] denotes greatest integer function)

<br/><br/>2. Similarly, let $B$ be the set of students whose number is divisible by 3. Hence, $n(B) = \left[\frac{140}{3}\right] = 46$. ([.] denotes greatest integer function)

<br/><br/>3. Let $C$ be the set of students whose number is divisible by 5. Hence, $n(C) = \left[\frac{140}{5}\right] = 28$.

<br/><br/>So far, we've found the number of students who opted for Mathematics ($n(A)$), Physics ($n(B)$), and Chemistry ($n(C)$).

<br/><br/>We also need to consider the students who have opted for multiple subjects :

<br/><br/>1. $n(A \cap B)$ represents the count of numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., d...

### Example 5 (Year: 2020)

**Question:**

If A = {x $$ \in $$ R : |x| &lt; 2} and B = {x $$ \in $$ R : |x – 2| $$ \ge $$ 3};
then :

**Solution:**

A : x $$ \in $$ (–2, 2); 
<br><br>B : x $$ \in $$ (–$$\infty $$, –1] $$ \cup $$ [5, $$\infty $$)
<br><br>$$ \Rightarrow $$ B – A = R – (–2, 5)
